[[Dia]] immediately calls out to those who can fight to prepare themselves, and instructs the rest to hide. [[Inky]] gives his familiar dragon’s breath and prepares for the battle ahead while Rohan calls out explaining that we need to destroy the window. [[Arythas]] attacks the window to try to break it as the first soldiers show and step through the portal. Each soldier is constructed to be an idealized elf — think Loegalas’ aryan brothers.

Combat starts. We manage to take care of the threat in here and in the banquet hall, and destroy the window portals. We then all split up to check on everyone and everything else.

Dia, Arythas, and [[Iskra]] head to the gym to find [[Ogmog]] in critical condition. The entire room is set up like an arena with a battle area, with seats for spectators and an area for weapons.

Iskra casts wind ward to protect Ogmog from a looming automaton and Dia heals him. Arythas bursts out of the ward and destroys the window in here to ensure that nothing else can enter. After, Iskra uses cure wounds on [[Hamir]] and he mends his sout with the help of Dia. Ogmog, Hamir, and the others take care of the automatons with Arythas.

[[Rohan]] and Inky go to the library to find that most of the people here were attacked by book constructs and everything is torn to shreds. Most of the people in here are dead, seemingly by teeth and nails. [[Szotszi]] is critically wounded, as is [[Lufir]]. [[Yugurda]] is standing here as well, mostly okay but terrified. Things in here are dealt with and one of the elf sisters in the room casts healing word on Lufir. Inky casts cure wounds on him and the kid relaxes and falls into Inky’s arms.

The entire party comes together in the trophy room. There are a few constructs and wolf [[Captain Kearney]] is standing in hat and coat. She howls triumphantly and morphs back into her human form, then asks where Dia is. We explain she’s healing and bandaging people up. Dia, Arythas, and Iskra tend to the wounded while Rohan and Inky investigate the door trapping us in. Inky can tell that the lock itself is timed. If the assault didn’t work then the goal is to starve everyone down here out.

Hamir explains that we can attempt to go up to the guards, or we can go down to the network of caverns beneath the city. One of the sisters that helped earlier said they can keep the survivors alive down here if we can forge a path forward. She points out that we are assumed to be dead, so we have time to move about the city and we recall that the wine cart is still 3 days away from reaching the city.

As we sit around and discuss, Rohan explains he may have gotten us some help from the outside. As we start grilling him on what he means by that, Rohan backs himself into a corner and explains that the help is an Invoker. We understand and are glad for this.

Dia is very intentional in getting a letter from General Ogmog giving us the authority to speak to the king and related guards people. She then takes Valtar to another room to speak. She wishes she could explain things without all of this mess happening, then explains we are going to leave to create a path. She asks [[Valtar]] to stay and protect everyone here, and thanks him.

We then take a long rest. During the long rest, Inky goes to speak to Szotszi in the library to show her some necromancy things. They find a book with proof of necromancy in other worlds.
