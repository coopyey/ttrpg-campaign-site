My information about the [[Abbey of St. Cuthbert]]:

- survived numerous sieges in the past
- no sign of special weaponry
- not enough space for emergency food supplies

It is a dark and stormy night as we travel through the mountains. St. Cuthbert’s is near to all of us as we travel through the mountains. The storm seems to be worsening in the distances approaching. It comes on quick and we all rush to get out of the storm.

[[Arythas]] is hit with the storm’s wind and the cold reminds him of the time his village was destroyed and he recalls finishing digging the graves of the dead. He straightens up and goes to gather his things and goes to find the friend he is traveling with.

[[Iskra]] realizes there are fey in these mountains and fey are what created this storm.

[[Braden Corrur]] — the monk of the abbey that let us in

[[Abott Dugald]] — huge, gregarious man

The followers of St. Cuthbert are lawful and tend to live a simple, plain lifestyle.

[[Iskra]] pulls out a pipe and starts smoking herbs of some sort while [[Rohan]] tries to pass off that he is a traveling pilgrim, but Arythas can see through this ruse. Iskra brings up the storm outside ad its origins from the fey. The abbott explains that hey don’t work with the fey, but they did have an agreement with the with the fey. He isn’t sure why she (the fey) is upset, though. We find out that the fey in question is [[Frosty Princess Glaciebella]].

The abbott advises we should not visit the library, as the librarian is quite grumpy. After, Arythas asks about the fey but the abbott genuinely isn’t sure what has changed. Rohan joked that one of us brought her here, and thus the storm.

[[Dia]] spills wine into her lap and goes to change her clothes, then all of us go to visit the library. We are given entry by the grumpy librarian. It is densely packed with books in stacks on the floor, and there are clearly more books than there is space.

[[The Family of Light]] runs the Church of Pelor. They’re a megachurch for Pelor, like those tv evangelical types. The whole “let our family help your family” thing.

[[Brother Raghnall]] is the high clerk that studied at the abbey and [Inksnout] would like more information on him here. Inky then asks for books about the local area — the country, the mountain pass, etc. Inky approaches Iskra to work together to find out what is going on with Frosty Princess Glaciebella.

Characters:

- Rohan J Corvo — tiefling rogue warlock
- Emlyn Diana Holless (Dia) — human cleric of Pelor
- Iskra — harengon wildfire sorcerer with a wolf
- Inksnout — kobold articifer/wizard

Inky asks the librarian if he knows what is going on with the fey. The librarian has two books: one of fables, and the second is a journal/diary of someone who has personally spoken with the fey princess. We check these out to read.

The librarian points out that there have been no new people to the abbey for a year now.

We all return to the room and Dia wished to share some information with us. She spoke with a monk while after she went to change her clothes and she thinks things are bad. The fey is mad at the people of the abbey — they have a shrine to her. This is a little strange in a place of faith, but if there were issues in the past then this was the arrangement that was agreed upon. None of these offerings were taken in a month, and the storms have been for a year with no knew parishioners. Normally, new parishioners come monthly at least.

We are also not the only visitors here, according to what Dia learned. This directly contradicts what the abbott told us.

After doing some investigation, Rohan explains a very powerful dark mage is staying at the abbey. Dia realizes that Pelor and St. Cuthbert will host people who are penitent and can allow them hermitage as they repent for their sins.

**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INKY HAS TAKEN MANY LIVES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

The dark mage has been here for quite some time, we think. It is possible they are the cause of this and we need to do further investigation into them.

We go and look for the hermitage where the dark mage is being kept. We find a corridore that ends in the stone until with a hidden door. The torches that had been keeping the path lit start to go out as a darkness approaches, a voice beginning to chant:

>*ring a ring of roses, pocket full of posies, a tissue a tissue, we all fall down

This is repeated again in a very demonic voice.

As a note: warlockism isn’t illegal here, but Rohan’s patron being a demon isn’t awesome. A fey warlock is okay, but a demonic patron isn’t good.
