**Session Notes:** 1/7/2024

I was gone for session 37. Apparently the entire party gambled. [[Rohan]]’s father was a demon lord known as [[Fraz-Urb'luu]], the Prince of Deception, which we also figured out in session 37 while I was gone. [[Inky]] also summoned red Inky, the rogue, to steal something.

[[Arythas]] wakes up from his nap and the rest of the party seem to be quite pleased with themselves. He asks why they look like they made off like bandits and [[Dia]] explains that they went to gamble and they seem to have won quite a bit. [[Iskra]] says that they were likely protected by [[Phoebe]], though it’s clearly not the case. He asks what they won and they explain that they won information, and seven tokens they can use to get magic items from the train. Dia holds the tokens out and there’s six, then she pulls the seventh out.

Arythas admits to having gone to the library to try to find more information about the library itself. He doesn’t delve into what he found or his thoughts, and Dia notices that it wasn’t the full truth he was telling. Inky speaks up and recommends that Arythas does not dig into the library because he doesn’t know where the library is from, but it wouldn’t bother him if it were a bad place, but he knows it would bother you. Arythas admits that he just is curious because he wants to Inky to be safe and to not be put in harm’s way, and he expresses that he just wants to be sure that Inky is safe and that the library isn’t being run by someone with nefarious purposes.

Inky speaks up and explains that he’s come across information to attain a magical item that will likely be used for evil if we don’t pick it up first. Inky explains where the dead drop will be and what’s going on with it.

We arrive at [[Harros]] and there’s a half-elf that is disembarking with us. He’s the only other person with a weapon and he has a black suit and is attempting to have the air of a soldier. He has an elaborate crossbow in his hands. He is clearly not an actual soldier or hasn’t been blooded, but he absolutely has a purpose and he has a plan of some sort. He holds himself as a kid of a noble or adjacent to. Inky approaches him and asks where the crossbow came from and he explains that it’s something that he bought and he made some adjustments to it for his own use. He goes into detail to explain to Inky, which is what Inky wanted. The crossbow is very fancy: it’s basically a repeating heavy crossbow that even has some magical function to it, but he just mentions that it’s special.

Inky calls Rohan over to try to extract information on where this crossbow came from. He explains that he got it from a specialist in [[Acria]] so that it was lighter and better for hunting, especially in the forest. Dia recognizes the phrase of the hunt and hides behind Arythas, which the man interprets as Dia having a huge crush on him. He thinks this is going well.

[[Belavor Brill]] — Dia recognizes the Brill name. They’re definitely a rich family that helps to fund the church of the Family of Light enough that Dia’s father writes a letter to them. Dia’s never interacted with them as they’re in a completely different part of the country. The Brill family is known for shipping logistics.

Rohan asks about the crossbow and Belavor explains that the crossbow is light and there are also runes that make it lighter and easier to handle. This is a hunting weapon, not a battle weapon. The crowd begins to grow bigger and Belavor is excited as his “shot” is already arriving, and he asks to take his leave. He looks directly at Dia and invites her to come along. Dia decides to accept this invite and links arm with him. He asks her to share anything about herself and Dia deflects and asks him to tell her about him. Belavor explains that in Harros there’s a special prey to hunt, which Dia feigns interest.

Belavor explains that she will learn what this prey is soon enough. They continue walking and we find an elevated platform in the center of a square, and there is also a free space there. Most of the people are from Harros while there are also people from the train that went to the crowd to see what’s going on. Belavor is the only outsider that seems to know what’s going on. On the platform there are people on the platform made to kneel with their hands behind their back and sack cloths on their heads. Before them stands a man that looks a bit like a preacher but he doesn’t seem to be overtly religious. He waits for everyone to settle and for the crowd to form, then he raises his hands and explains he is [[Judge Orus]] Graf and this trial has now begun.

The first has been accused of burglary, murder, and stealing cattle. The accused is unable to speak and the Judge explains we know what the verdict will be and that we all know why we are here. The people begin to chant “Wolves’ Head” over and over. The Judge explains the rules of man have been broken so they will be treated as animals, so divine judgement shall begin. Two people’s backs arch and something goes on within the sack cloth. The cloth bursts and they have malformed wolves heads rather than human heads. This is a polymorph magic of some kind. The guards cut their ropes and the Judge says that these are no longer people and they are pariahs. The guards kick them off of the platform and seeing the circle of people broken, a street is open and the half transformed begin running toward the free street while Belavor takes aim at the people.

Dia grabs Belavor and acts as if she was scared to shake his aim, which makes him angry. His anger dissipates quickly as he realizes what’s going on with Dia.

The priest is wearing the symbol of Melora, the nature goddess. Melora is the goddess of wilderness and the sea. The way these guys are worshiping Melora are definitely worshiping her as a fringe group. This isn’t a wrong way to worship her, but it’s definitely not the common way of honoring her.

Dia tries to use the mom card on Belavor and he explains his mother bought him the ticket to be here. He does admit that in civilized country this would never be acceptable but he would really enjoy being able to actually hunt these people. Dia tries to pick a fight but Rohan puts a hand on her shoulder and pulls her back. Inky casts message and tells Belavor that he’s a loser, and asks if he is gonna let her talk to him like this. Belavor mutters that the doctors said he wasn’t real, which Inky hears.

Rohan tries to make an appeal to Dia’s better senses and explains that this is their ritual and we can’t stop this. Dia is clearly in a complete state of rage and looks at Rohan. Rohan realizes that Belavor was possessed for a while and it messed him up — he was possessed because he was a rotten kid, but he was basically helped so that it wouldn’t be a problem anymore.

Active effect: Share Life (10 Minutes)

Inky uses message again to Belavor. Arythas casts fear on the man and he is clearly not okay. He fires a bolt off and Rohan pushes Dia out of the way. She stumbles onto the ground and stands as Arythas casts share life on her. Dia uses command on him and commands him to stay where he is right now. He just stops. Inky casts message and calls him a coward to try to push him. Iskra uses a spell to destroy the crossbow.

Rohan asks [[Taraaq]] what the name of the demon that possessed Belavor, and Taraaq figured out it was Emoz. Rohan walks up to Belavor with all the confidence in the world and says that Emoz would like to have a word with you. Belavor is surprised and is about to ask how Rohan would know. Rohan leans in closer and says the more he goes down this route the more this will happen, and he asks if Belavor wants this to happen? And then says that he needs to get his shit together. He turns and runs back to the train.
