[[Inky]]'s player can't be here today so Inky will be in  [[The Library Between]] with [[Mattai]] working out plans to store explosives there.

---

We get up the next morning and find that Inky has left a note saying that he is going to the library and not to wait up with us, and [[Rohan]] stays with [[Kestrel St. Clair]] at the inn. [[Arythas]] goes to visit his family for breakfast, with [[Iskra]] and [[Dia]] tagging along with him to do that.

[[Nepin]] - who insists on being called auntie - fusses over Arythas and insists that he eats more because he's a little too thin. [[Aphen]] is a little more awkward, struggling a little with conversation, but the environment is comfortable and homey. Dia helps with everyone's tea, and sneaks Arythas a very sweet, complex, herbal tea, which he really likes.

---

Rohan and Kestrel flirt with each other, and Kestrel says that Rohan should go on a heist with him. Rohan says that he needs to avoid Dia and Arythas, and Kestrel teases him saying that he should steal something so that Rohan can chase him down and they can run off together to do so.

Kestrel says goodbye to Rohan and he joins up with the rest of us at [[Nepin]]'s home and politely declines any food, admitting he'd like to have a takeaway bag essentially.

Dia gets permission to stay here to plan things out. Aphen says that is fine, they will not snitch, and Iskra asks if there is a fire department here and that makes Aphen concerned. Aphen says that there isn't a specific fire department, but the citizens are organized and ready to go if something *does* happen. Arythas and Dia are so suspicious of both Iskra and Rohan at this time.

Dia explains that the vague plan is to create a distraction and sneak Bertram out. Dia would like to get everyone out of the prison because she feels that here is an unnatural darkness there, but she is not willing to risk Bertram's life on this hunch. She brings up possibly restoring the Warden to how he was before, and perhaps that would allow people to be released, or let us walk out, but we can't rely on that either.

[[Cruelwind Prison]] is a few days away from where we are and Aphen says that their son [[Nilmuk]] may have a cart as he is trying to be a business man - and then says that Arythas should really talk to him and get to know him - but that does not feel necessarily realistic to go.

---

We discuss a plan about splitting the party up and part of the party scouting the prison ahead of time to try to figure things out. What it boils down to is that Iskra and Arythas need to go with Dia or Rohan up to the prison - the split doesn't matter - but the latter must be with one of the former due to the previous attempts at kidnapping, and Iskra make the point that Arythas and Iskra will not hesitate to kill someone to protect Rohan and Dia. Everyone agrees with this.

Rohan asks if we should go sneaky without permission, or try to get permission, and Dia says that either way, we need the opportunity to look around the place. When Iskra brings up the idea of going in through a secret tunnel or sewer, Arythas suggests that Iskra is the one to go as he is not particularly sneaky, and those types of tunnels are rarely made with someone his size in mind. We all agree on this split.

Dia asks when they will leave and Rohan says they should leave sooner rather than later.

[[Taraaq]] speaks up and says that statistically someone has to have a pact within the prison, and comes back to say that someone from the [[Crimson Legion]] is there. He's a warlock paladin type, and Dia says that's actually quite promising as both she and Arythas knows one of the leaders.

Dia says to be careful, and Arythas says that if anything happens to please let them know and the rest of them will rush there as fast as they can to give support. Rohan says they will check in often.

Rohan recommends that we speak to [[General Chase]] and try to determine if there is magic hanging over the man, and Dia says that is a good idea, and lets the two of them know to let us know if they think we need any extra supplies. Iskra promises to do his best to protect Rohan.

They set off riding Robin the wolf to head to the prison.
