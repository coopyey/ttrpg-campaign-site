[[Inky]] wakes up to the sound of two explosions. One was close, the second was far.

The guy that explodes does so from the inside out: first [[Dia]] is engulfed by read flame, then gone black. Dia comes to and [[Soldas]] had protected her. [[Arythas]] realizes that he is being healed at half and Dia is also aware of this. Everyone else gets to us and [[Iskra]] casts healing spirit and the spirit gets him back to normal order, the necrotic energy purged and cleansed. He explains he came to check on the rookies and this happened.

They did not receive wine from the abbey, they don’t have information of who recruited who. Rohan says there was a second explosion that also happened with [[The Family of Light]].

Iskra points out that the wine clearly isn’t the problem here, but something else is. Dia recalls the traveller mentioned in the abbey that visited before we did. [[Rohan]] and Inky can see the after image and trace of necrotic energy. It is connected to [[Nerull]], but it is also different than the energy that infected the wine.

Under his breath, Rohan asks his patron if they are seeing this. A voice he is unfamiliar with asks what he wants, and Rohan asks what is going on. The female voice goes off about how Rohan doesn’t even know his patron’s name, and razzes him for it. She reviews what happened and tells Rohan to contact his patron, who is named [[Taraaq]]. She explains that the necrotic explosion shouldn’t be possible right now, and this hasn’t been seen for a few millennia. It is a netherflame fireball, to be specific. She tells him to talk to his patron and stop being so fucking rude.

>Netherflame was a tool of Nerull and his followers. It is incredibly connected to Nerull, so it’s manifestation means that Nerull is close.

Rohan’s dagger changes and turns into soulflayer teeth with the dagger covered in frost. It’s a +1 to attack and +1d4 cold damage when attacking with it. It has the returning trait. On a failed CON save: -1 AC, -1 save, half movement.

They go over to check on the Family of Light.

[[Soldas]] has runes etched into his skin but they are gone now. He contained the explosion himself and reassures us that he is okay only because of Iskra and his magic. Inside their camp is much more gruesome events — more people were together when the followers exploded. [[Rafferty]] and [[Shevore]] are hurt, but conscious. Dia pushes through the crowd to get to the scene, with Arythas hot on her heels as they go. Dia stops before Rafferty and goes to heal Shevore. Rafferty is playing the role of a paladin to appear noble. Dia does go to Shevore and heals her first as her left arm was still aflame.

Inky drops down off of Arythas’ shoulder and walks over to Shevore. Dia and Iskra heal the base damage but she is still infected with the necrotic energy. Inky comes up and purges her of the corruption using false life. Inky thinks he could use this to create a spell or ritual that could cleanse the undead energy off of people. Some of the healers watching manage to copy it to stop the others from being infected at the camp.

Dia goes to Rafferty and gives him the disappointment stare. He asks if she saw the explosion and if that is why she is out — she shows her arm. He asks who did this and she confirms it wasn’t the [[Bloodsoaked Banner]] and she won’t tell him who as she wishes to help him. She asks if it is what he signed up for. Rafferty says he wants to be a paladin and she asks if he truly wants this — she says he wants the fame and glory, but does he want to see the violence and loss? Rafferty says yes, if that’s what it takes. She turns and goes to leave — he calls out to her and she steps and sees he is shaken and unsure of himself. He looks small as she turns and walks away.

We return to the Bloodsoaked Banner and take a rest so that we can plan. Inky checks out a book on how to slay dragons. It’s a book written by hobgoblins. Inky didn’t expect that this would work. The book is bound in iron but once it is animated the front binding is what turns into a goblin face. Inky shoves the book into his bag for now.

Rohan, during the rest, is away from the group and he calls for Taraaq — he explains he talked to [[Denma]] and she said hi. Rohan asks how many there are and Taraaq explains he is the only patron, but they are all trying something new. Taraaq is a demon. He was an ifrit before he was a demon. Demona was once an angel, but she’s now a devil. There is a group of fiends that got together to give power and he explains that nobody has been listening to him. All of these guys want out — Taraaq wants out of the Abyss, and Demona out of the Hells. They want to ascend. Rohan is advised by Taraaq not to admit to a pact with a fiend. Rohan finishes the conversation up and heads back to the group.

We are resting in the tent, having an awkward conversation. Dia explains Emlyn is her real name, and Dia is her middle name. She has never been asked what she wants to be called and we respect that. We learn that Dia has five siblings and Inky says he has like forty-two siblings. Dia is feeling delayed fear, sadness, and pride — though the pride confuses her. Inky also figures out that Rohan is a warlock after he tries to reassure her that she doesn’t need magic to help it. The group heads out to find the Earthshaker.

On the way out, Dia falls back with Rohan and explains that he doesn’t have to hide his magic and she is happy to talk about it when he is ready. Dia reassures him that it’s okay and picks up her speed to walk with the rest of the party.

We continue on and find the snowman still standing. Iskra sees footprints near the snowman, and the snowman has been repaired. Based on the maps, the Familiy will be here sooner than the Bloodsoaked Banner, so we must hurry. Iskra follows the path and we find a grove on the other side of the mountain. Following the brook to eventually come upon a wooden house. A pillar of metal is next to a a hatchet on the ground. Arythas sees that this might have been the Earthshaker’s axe, left to rust. The weapon the Earthshaker used was an enormous maul that was connected to [[Bahamut]]. Dia admires the maul — it is taller than she is — then goes to the door and knocks on it.

[[Artem Vorvarax]] answers the door and is surprised to see us. He invites us inside and we admit that people are looking for him. Dia explains Rafferty idolizes him and wants to be trained by him. We also explain that the Bloodsoaked Banner is also looking at him and she is honest about Rafferty’s goals. She explains the goals of the Bloodsoaked Banner.

The Earthshaker heals the rest of Dia’s wounds and then explains his issues with both sides of the story: Bahamut is an unworthy God. This (obviously) pisses Arythas off and he calls the Earthshaker unworthy. Iskra asks Arythas if he should kill him, and Arythas says no — he has to live with the guilt of everything he’s done and failed to do. Rohan butts in and asks if it’s the world that is wrong. There is a moment where everyone argues, then the Earthshaker eventually breaks down crying and Dia hugs him to comfort him. They break apart and the Earthshaker asks for help carrying his weapon, so Arythas (grudgingly) agrees at the insistence of Inky. They all head out back towards the settlements. Arythas eventually asks if the Earthshaker had any other choice, and the Earthshaker explains that he thought it was the best choice because the ritual.

While the party walks, Inky starts asking Rohan about his magic and Rohan denies knowing magic. Inky ultimately has the impression that Rohan is a sorcerer and just doesn’t know that he’s a sorcerer.

We make it back to the Bloodsoaked Banner. Soldas offers to send for Rafferty and we agree to it, so we go to his tent and wait for Shevore and Rafferty to arrive. Shevore thanks Inky for the help, and he thanks her instead. She tells us that the mages have been sent to help melt the avalanche fall. Soldas begins the negotiations for which group will get the Earthshaker, but they are interrupted with the sound of drums and battle while someone calls out that they are being attacked.
