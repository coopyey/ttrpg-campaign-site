We see Oceanscar and recall it used to be a dwarven city. The king’s palace and all noble quarters are underground. While the elves have taken this city, they do not destroy the things that have purpose. There are some abandoned buildings from when the orcs left, and there is some more recent build. The harbor is built into the cliff and so the shipyard is essentially underground. There are some airships that are coming and going.

The city gets its name as it is built on a jagged cliff and tehre is a legend of the gods cleaving the shoreline. Population is mostly elves, but there are also humans, gnomes, a halfling quarter, and a smattering of orcs. There are about a million people here.

Iskra recommends we use the [[Bloodsoaked Banner]] to ask for help to avoid having to ask Dia’s family for anything. With this, Dia whips out the [[Bloodsoaked Banner Alliance Mark]] and displays it visibly so that they know we are friends of theirs.

A group of kobolds in pinstripe suits pass by. We are going the same way as them, but eventually they turn off to go down an alley toward an establishment that seems to be for kobolds. We find a leaflet for a definitely 100% legit business that is basically the kobold mafia. Drakeheart is a popular kobold name.

We pass the kobolds up (for now) and head toward the Bloodsoaked Banner crew.We pass a new temple for Bane on the way, and we recall that [[Bane WIP]] is a god of war. He is lawful, and the temple being here is rather unusual.

Outside of the Bloodsoaked Banner area there is a gnome and a warforged washing away graffiti. The warforged is tanky — big like Arythas, with dark grey plating, and red eyes. It’s right hand is replaced with a cheap skeletal hand. Warforged use “it”, and all gnomes are non-binary but accept “they”.

The warforged greets us and asks us if we are here to help, or if we’re here to cause trouble. The gnome explains that these two are all of the Bloodsoaked Banner here, and they are not a well-liked group in Oceanscar. They have a place for us to stay if we need, and we may need to help around the the place. We are ushered inside to discuss the fact that we want an audience with the king. This post is able to hold 100 people, so it feels very empty. The furnishings are old and in disrepair. It’s very clear they do not have much in the way of resources.

The warforged is named [[Siege WIP]] , and the gnome is named [[Inali]] . Inali has fox ears.

We explain that we need to see the king because his life and the lives of others are in danger. Inali is not sure they believe that undead exists, but they can tell that we are being genuine and we believe what we are saying. They think they can scrounge up some veterans to help us spot the cart we are looking for as it arrives to the city, and so we describe the cart that we are looking for in detail.

Otherwise, Inali recommends that we may be able to find a gang that has enough upper reach to get us an audience. They recommend that we do not share information with the Baneites because they would raze the city if they were given the chance, but they recognize we do not have much in the way of other options and the Baneites certainly have the reach we need.

The [[Church of Bane]] wasn’t invited, they just sort of showed up one day. They are not a subtle group: Bane is lawful evil. They’re willing to witch hunt and call out anyone they think is an issue.

Dia and Arythas head to the Church of Bane to speak with them. There is a man outside with a guitar, speaking with some children. He’s just finishing their conversation up as we walk up, so he wraps up and sends the kids off and then Inali introduces us all to each other. We learn the man is [[Father Caleb Truestrike]] and Arythas cuts to the point and explains that we need help getting an audience with the king. We explain that we were sent fro the [[Abbey of St. Cuthbert’s WIP]] and the Father is excited by this and says a higher level friend of the church will be here soon.

A procession of elfin knights shows up at the temple, escorting a blonde elf in magical armor that is beautiful, fitting, and well-worn. She belongs to one of the wealthiest families of Oceanscar, and she is [[Lady Eltun Cordon]]. Dia and Arythas bow to her.

The Lady is amused by all of this, and Dia introduces us and asks for an audience with the king, explaining what she can while leaving out specific information about the necromancy. The Lady can tell we are not being completely honest, but she invites us to a soiree she’s putting on in two days where we can all attend and provide some entertainment. The soiree will be in her summer home. She gets us invites and then we leave, find a cafe to sit down in, and relax while Dia calms down.

Rohan, Iskra, and Inky split to go find another source of help, if possible. They head back to [[Legitimate Business & Bar]] and Inky runs into his cousin, [[Clinky]] . The bar itself is mostly designed for small creatures such as kobolds, but there are some tables to the side for smaller medium creatures. (Read: Arythas would struggle in here.)

They are reintroduced with [[Trusty]] who isn’t sure how to help, but Rohan ultimately requests contacts. They aren’t thrilled with this request but they take the group to the back area where there is a poker table and smoke everywhere. Trusty asks exactly what they need, and Iskra explains that we need an audience with the king. There is some back and forth about what specifically is required and they realize it would be better if the kobold mafia could tell them where the cart is.

The kobold mafia will help, but the three owe the mafia a favor in the form of a job, to be called in at a later time.

Rohan is then given directions to a bank in town. He gets there and presents the money order, to which the teller — Xenara — gets the money for Rohan and hands him a coin purse. Rohan asks her if she can tell who created the money order because he was curious who he is working for. Xenara says she can, but it will take a while, so he’ll need to come back the next day for the information. He thanks her and heads out.

The group comes back together. The cart is 5 days away.
