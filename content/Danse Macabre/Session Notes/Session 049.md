We hike for a few days with [[Bertram]] and [[Corwin Sorensen]]. Corwin is bitching the entire time on our way out, and Bertram basically looks at a map and we go incredibly far up north. The understanding is that maybe some of us can run, but we definitely don't have the supplies to last very long out here so it is smarter to go and do this job and return. We end up near something that Bertram calls a temple, though he doesn't go into many details. We enter the temple are surrounded by the undead.

Also [[Emily]] has a pet bear named Xion (pronounced zion).

[[Wilhelm]] can tell that Bertram is under geas and he cannot explain more than he already has, even though he very clearly wants to explain more. He is simply compelled not to.

Combat begins again five skeleton warriors.
- AC: 18
- Resist: Slashing?

We finish combat and [[Emily]] asks what the fuck was happening, and Bertram explains that the enemies are undead, and they are real. He explains he can tell us things but only after they happen, which he admits is not helpful. Bertram explains that the Warden knows about the undead skeletons in here. We're here to retrieve something in the mountain, the entrance being nearby. He doesn't know if we're going to run into any more enemies, it's possibly trapped but he's not sure, this is his first time going in here.

The bear starts to move about searching for more undead and [[Nakha]] can tell that something about Emily's bear is off - they aren't sure if the bear is always breathing. Emily calls the bear off and away from Nakha, explaining that he wants his body very much, to which Nakha explains that they never doubt animals about it, but there's something wrong with this creature. Emily says that Nakha's one to talk about that, and Nakha sighs and resigns from this. We all move on deeper to where we need to go.

There's the sound of a creature rasping up ahead. It hasn't seen our group yet, but we see something that looks as if it were made of shadow peer out, and then retreat back into the chamber it's wandering around. It doesn't seem to be patrolling or anything like that, just vibing in the place it's in now. It's clear that this appears to be some part of a temple. The symbols in the temple are related to a long-forgotten god of death, but Nakha doesn't recall their name.

Nakha moves further in to a sarcophagus and notices a second shadow creature walking around. They open up the sarcophagus next to them. They peek inside and there is a mummy inside, the body mutilated after death. There is a scroll in their corpsey hands, but there's no loot.

Emily notices that a shadow seems to take notice that something has happened, though it doesn't attack Nakha yet.

The area that Emily and Nakha are at were worn away from erosion and appear to be a temple entrance. Wilhelm and [[Khar'rik]] start to wander away from the others, noticing what appears to be the entrance of a temple carved into the stone. Bertram comes up and says perhaps we shouldn't split up, and Khar'rik explains that we are scouting.

There is a shrieking sound from one of the shadows as it finally notices Nakha. Combat begins.
