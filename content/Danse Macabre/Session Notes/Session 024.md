We open with some friendly sparring (read: reviewing how to do combat with new classes). This is the vast majority of the session.

At the end, Dia heals everyone and helps them up, chewing out the spell casters for using fire spells which aren’t non-lethal. Inky uses tortuous trauma on Dia to prove he does have some non-lethal spells and the rest of the group is trying to explain how this works and how it was inappropriate, though Inky doesn’t understand.

Dia storms off and Captain Kearney tries to talk to Dia about it.

Iskra yells for the Captain and she comes over. Iskra asks if there are any etiquette books or something that we can give to Inky and she doesn’t really have any.

Dia goes to hide again. Rohan tries to find her but fails miserably (boyfriend FaceTimed him, you know). Dia’s in the bottom or second level of the ship up in the rafters, somewhere small, holding her knees and blank staring. Inky eventually speaks into the message earring and apologizes but Dia takes out the ear piece and throws it across the room. Demna mentions that the apology isn’t nearly enough for what happened.

Iskra looks for Dia and finds the earpiece, then little bits of corn lands on their head and bounces off - Dia essentially throwing birdseed to get his attention. His comment is that he prefers sunflower seeds but thank you? Dia explains she’s up above and the wolf teleports up to Dia. Iskra says he’s not good at speaking but if she wants to hang out with the wolf she most certainly can. Dia offers to brush his hair to make it softer and he explains it’s been a while since he’s taken care of himself. Iskra asks if she needs anything and she says no, she’s got everything. Iskra points out she’s had a rough week and she says it’s okay and he asks if it really is okay. Iskra notices she has her bag with her and looks as if she was ready to just get up and leave, though we’re in the middle of the ocean and so she can’t just do that.

Dia says it’s fine and she’ll get over it. Iskra says that she shouldn’t need to do that. Dia explains that she still needs our help with the whole husband thing, and finding her missing brother and whatever it is he’s up to.

Iskra says that if we are too much for her then he wouldn’t be upset but he’s sure that the others might not want her to leave. Iskra says that he doesn’t want her to leave but he can respect it if she feels she needs to find a new group to be with. Dia admits she does feel tempted to stay on the ship but even despite everything, she did have her first kiss (which makes Iskra panic internally). Dia explains the captain kissed her, and Iskra stutters and asks if this is a good thing, if Dia enjoyed it? Dia says she thinks it’s good.

Iskra explains that she ultimately has a choice to make and Dia points out she’s never had the option to choose before. Iskra does point out that eventually she’ll get everything she wants, and Dia says it’s a ways away. Iskra feels it’s a good motivation to keep going, though. Dia admits she doesn’t know what she wants (and Iskra says you don’t have to know!). Dia asks Iskra to tell her what he wants despite the fact he isn’t really wanting to be forthcoming with it. Iskra asks Dia not to freak out and she makes no promises. Iskra explains he doesn’t want to be dead, but he wishes he had never existed so that others could live rather than have died.

Dia explains that what happened wasn’t his fault, and Iskra says he knows, but it’s still what he wants even if it’s not what Dia may want to hear. He doesn’t know if it could change but it’s what he’s been working for all of these years. He hopes that Dia has better and Dia asks what about all of what is happening now? All of the things we’ve done - would none of that have happened? He guesses so. Dia asks if his wish was to never have existed, then who would be dead now? How would we have lived to get here now? They spend a lot of time cycling through what ifs.

Dia walks through how Iskra is strong, how he’s been through so much and he still chooses to do good. Iskra feels he doesn’t have another choice and Dia reassures him he sure does.
