[[Belavor Brill]] is not going to hunt anyone, returning to the train instead. He returns to his compartment to sulk so we do not see us. We go to the dead drop location and find a puzzle box that Inky needs to work through.

We walk around a little bit, then return to the train. The train continues and then stops at a scheduled stop. There was not supposed to be a settlement here, but there’s actually a stronghold that’s been built up here. We and the crew of the train is surprised that this is here. There are two half-ogres that take and start moving things. Dia disguises herself as basically Rohan’s sister — femme version of him — and we watch Jyl struggle to offload the vampire casket.

Three or four goblinoids exit the stronghold. The one leading is a hobgoblin of some type. They are well armed but we do not see any signs of status or allegiance. Iskra, Inky, and Rohan know that the shadow goblinoids are Varags. They’ve been modified so that they are a combination of a hobgoblin and a direwolf. They are not a natural species but were created through some means, though they are full citizens and treated as real people. The leader of the group is tall and muscular, with a lightning scar on the right side of his face. There is one more goblin behind him with glasses and a quill.

The leader approaches Jyl and greets her, ignoring everyone else. Glasses pays Jyl and the hobgoblin says to take the package to the fort at once and the Varags say yes. They call him “archon” and Arythas knows that this is a word that can mean a few things depending on context:

- Prince such as the direct child of an emperor
- Demigod

The hobgoblin finally notices us watching and greets us. Rohan gives some bullshit about how Jyl’s incredibly capable, and he asks if it would be okay for us to go ahead and see the delivery of this casket through. He looks at Rohan and says that everyone is welcome in the fort, and that he’s recently conquered this land — the glasses whispers into his ear, and he corrects to say that he purchased the land. He explains there will be a town for as long as necessary, and everyone is welcome inside as they are not in a state of war at the moment. Rohan thanks him for his hospitality. Jyl counts her money and is surprised as she made more money than expected — she was paid in raw gold rather than stamped currency.

Arythas would know that if they wanted a vampire they’d just go get a vampire. Arythas is aware that this is not something that they’d have to really be sneaky about — transporting a vampire isn’t illegal.

Dia goes up to follow the casket. Inside the stronghold there are more types of goblinoids than she’s ever seen before, and she quickly ducks behind somewhere to disguise herself as a hobgoblin. They go to a tent with the crate, and when they leave they leave without it. She can tell that this is definitely a warcamp but that’s the default state for hobgoblins.

Iskra, meanwhile, stealths into the camp and is hidden as the rest of the party enters the camp casually. Rohan enters the tent with the crate and sees a large glass contraption that looks like it’s from an alchemist’s lab: a big glass sphere in the middle with several things going in and out, machinery involved. They open the box and shove the vampire into the glass bowl without waking it. There’s a hobgoblin mage or alchemist waiting on a signal. Once given the green light it starts the process.

The vampire wakes up and tries to lunge at the Archon. The punch connects with the glass, then the vampire starts melting. It punches into the glass again and screams, though no sound escapes the glass. The creature is just completely undone and turned into the good soup.

The archon asks how much can be modified — the scientist says 4-5, and the archon says to learn which it is. He looks and addresses us, explaining that this is likely our first time seeing something like this. He explains that this is rather unnerving to most outsiders and it may be beneficial to share this knowledge with everyone in case they go to war. Dia asks what the intention is and the archon explains they’re here to explore a battlefield, and they will use this time to test some things while they’re here.

Inky asks if he can take notes, and the archon says that the answer is no if he can reproduce the effects. The archon explains this is a weapon so no, Inky cannot take notes.

Dia asks what battlefield and the archon recalls that we name things. He thinks as he tries to remember, then he says [[Amos Bridge WIP]] . He explains that he bought the land so that they could investigate. Dia asks if we may travel to investigate this area as well. He leans forward and says he will not parlay with people who use illusions, and she drops the illusion. He appreciates her candor and introduces himself as [[Ilxavar]].

Dia explains that she is curious about the machine in front of her. He continues the experiment and some of the vampire goop goes through the machine and then slaps into a hobgoblin. It goes into him and bubbles, and he develops very big fangs, his eyes go red, and then he explodes. The goblin and mage pull out notebooks and take notes. Ilxavar says there is no reason to continue testing as there needs to be adjustments to this as they are not sure if it is a bodily thing or the divine energy. He explains that they have not made a new warrior variant in some time, and he is excited to find a new hybrid.

The older hybrids such as a varag typically breed through in the usual way, but if they need something faster or if they lose the ability to breed and it’s a known type then it’s very easy for them to make more through these means as it’s basically pre-programmed.

He explains that while the war has stopped, the conflict persists and war is inevitable. Rohan speaks up and says that those that go down the path of fiends do not get what they want in the end and that making a deal with the devil only gives the devil what they want. Ilxavar agrees and says he only wants the physical aspects and pacts have been attempted in the past and it was too much bullshit to deal with.

Dia says that she does not wish to intrude any further as long as this is under control. She admits that we were concerned because those that deal with vampires rarely have good intentions and while she does not think preparing for a war that doesn’t exist is the best, she doesn’t think it is bad either. There is no morality in preparing for what they assume is the inevitable. She imagines that it will take them some time to gather what they need but we do not have time as a luxury. He asks if we wish to leave to the bridge, and Dia agrees: he is welcome to accompany us, or we may leave on our own. Ilxavar says we are welcome on _his_ expedition if we wish. The goblin scribe, [[Hushul]], will show us our place to stay. He finds a tent that currently has three people and we are added there.

Dia sounds frazzled and apologizes for getting us into this situation and we can move on if we please. Arythas explains he has interest in seeing this battlefield. She starts doing what she needs to unwind as we wait for
