There is a commotion outside and [[Dia]] peeks out to see that there is an attack. Nearby is an elf using an orb to talk to someone, though she cannot tell what they are saying. We are to take care of evacuate [[Artem Vorvarax]]. Dia says we will take the horses to escape and Dia tells [[Rafferty]] to man up and command his army. He nods and leaves to go command.

We sneak out of the tent and hear the elf commander talking and saying they did not see their master’s courier and they are smoking out the two groups. He crushes the orb and pulls out his bow and starts shooting at everyone, laughing maniacally while doing so. [[Arythas]], [[Iskra]], and the Earthshaker will be headed to the ridge with the snowman while Dia, [[Rohan]], and [[Inky]] will go to get the horses from [[The Family of Light]] camp.

Dia’s group is noticed by the elfin archer. They start running and Dia trips, spraining her ankle. Rohan uses a minor illusion to try to distract him. He is asking who they are and wonder if they know who they are looking for. Dia gets up and explains we are unaffiliated and we can simply leave, but he says he cannot leave any loose ends. Rohan asks what they want and says maybe we can help, which makes the man laugh more.

---

Iskra, Arythas, and the Earthshaker starts to leave and a group of thugs find us. The Earthshaker slams his foot to the ground and the earth splits open and the thug falls in. The battle ends.

---

The battle passes and the elf tries to disengage to come bother Arythas and company. Inky throws the weasel familiar at hime with it breathing fire. The elf misty steps toward Arythas and is trying to pat himself out. He tries to hit the Earthshaker with an arrow and misses. He is clearly displeased and teleports away.

---

Dia looks at the others and say they need to move. She gives herself expeditious retreat and she sees Rafferty wielding his new sword, though it is clear he has never been in a real battle. He has enthusiasm. He is not inspiring but he has the spirit as he is fighting a half-ogre. They make it to the horses and grab them to head out.

---

[[Bahamut]] had seven servants, which acted essentially as saints.

[[Marashok]] Detail — adamantine

- Bahamut’s body guard
- Warrior, friendly and genial

Arythas cannot connect to Bahamut at this time, *but he can connect to Marashok*. He can speak with his voice or wield his weapon.

It’s clear that the Earthshaker is pissed as each step he takes splits the earth open beneath him. Arythas tells him to stop and that we need to move on. He blames himself and feels he cannot ever escape this. Arythas tries to get him moving and he says that this needs to end now. He claps and it occurs to Arythas that fighting him would be a literal natural disaster. Everyone falls down and he coughs up blood. He tells Arythas to take the maul and let it do some good.

He starts having a heart attack and Arythas picks him up. Iskra heals him and stops the heart attack. As he heals the Earthshaker he has a flashback to a woman with silvery skin that is an elf or human. She treated Iskra with kindness, saying it wasn’t his fault and the person who did it to him would pay.

The entire group meets up and everyone gets on their horses and head to the Earthshaker’s cottage. Arythas puts him in bed and Dia takes care of him. DIa and Arythas are aware of the presence of Bahamut: he is having a dream, being visited by Bahamut. We rest here, watching over him.

Dia and Arythas spend some time chatting. Dia thanks Arythas for not picking a fight with the Earthshaker or Rafferty, and then she calls him kind. Arythas appreciates how open she is with her emotions and he says this is a good thing. Arythas also attunes to Marashok’s Tail. They also discuss moral quandries.

Iskra has a nightmare.

Rohan talks to his patron and asks if he should trust his powers. Taraaq explains he isn’t good at this because he is a demon and demons don’t do trust, and practice makes perfect with the powers. They discuss who Rohan can trust with his secret.

The next day, the Earthshaker awakens and explains he spoke with Bahamut and is better now. We return with the Earthshaker to the Bloodsoaked Banner, where Soldas gives us a mark of friendship, which Dia takes.

Iskra grabs Mordaine and gives him one silver coin filled with Iskra’s magic. This will let him know when Iskra is nearby.

We load up and leave the valley. We know we are mostly in the elfin countryside and we find a crossroads between [[Oceanscar]] and the capital [[Belshamon]]. We turn towards Oceanscar.
