Arythas attunes to Maroshak’s Tail and then we all get on our horses and leave the Earthshaker’s home to head towards Oceanscar.

Things are quiet for a while before Rohan speaks up about how we need to trust each other. Inky says that it’s okay that he is gay, and Roahn admits to the fact that he has magic. We all ask what else is new and point out that it’s more questionable that he is making such a big deal about having magic. Arythas asks if he should be concerned, and Rohan reassures him that it’s definitely totally 100% just normal magic. Quietly, Rohan speaks more with his patron.

After this there is some more chit chat as we go, and we follow the trail. Eventually the conversation turns to how Iskra became blind and he says that it was an accident in self-defense as Iskra attacked them. We continue on for a while longer, then set up for camp.

Inky prepares all of our food and makes a lovely stew. While it is cooking, Dia asks Iskra if he wishes to share his past. Iskra warns that it is bad, and he would understand if we no longer want him around. He weaves some magic with his fey weed so that we can have a more cinematic experience as he explains.

A red smoke envelopes us and the imagery is blurred and, for lack of a better term, glitching. Iskra is a lycanthrope with red open eyes, and he is huge adn covered in blood. He was cursed by somebody and we see flashes of moments of him killing people en masse. It’s clear he is not in control of himself and then we can see him wake up as himself, unaware of what happened. There is a woman who says she saved him, and he doesn’t know why she would have bothered. He cannot see very well because he was hurt while he was turned, though he doesn’t know by who.

Everyone except for Arythas can feel his emotions in every moment shown: his anger, his guilt. When it all ends, Iskra is crying. Dia is also crying as she hugs him and apologizes to him.

We know that lycanthropy is a curse that is managed and there is no known cure. Whatever happened to Iskra seems to be the cure, but not even he knows what exactly the woman did to cure him of it. Those that have the curse are not fully accountable for their actions due to the nature of the curse.

Dia and Rohan try to comfort Iskra, reassuring that it wasn’t him. The others discuss the difference between taking responsibility vs. tearing yourself down. Iskra knows who did this to him and knows they just enjoy this type of cruelty. Iskra isn’t sure he wants to see who did this to him, and he isn’t sure if they’re still doing this. Iskra has been a lycanthrope for 5 years, and he stopped aging once he contracted the curse.

Iskra explains that the man who turned him was named Tristan and he isn’t sure if Tristan is aware that he’s been cured. Tristan turns people for fun and takes enjoyment from it, but he wants to remove the curse from himself. Tristan was born with the curse and tried to remove it, but it made it worse. He’s now permanently in his lycanthrope form (as far as Iskra knows, anyway). Iskra doesn’t know how old Tristan is. Mordaine was the first person that Iskra has met that was also cursed by Tristan.

Taraaq feels bad for Iskra and offers to try to track down information on Tristan for the group.

Inky and Arythas agree to protect Iskra and delete Tristan from the face of the planet.

We go ahead and rest, then in the morning we tear down camp and continue on to Oceanscare. As we continue on, Iskra and Arythas notice some halflings on capybears: a mom, a dad, and two siblings. They’re waving at us. Dia knows that capybears are pretty much sentient. They have their own language and typically know at least some Halfling. Halflings do not se borders and they are very friendly and neighborly folk.

The family consists of:
- Mac (father)
- Malley (mother)
- Maurice
- Maddie

They are on the road to Temma — the halfling nomadic city. It is a full-fledged city that can just up and move.

Dia does most of the talking for us and she tells them were where are going. Dia eventually hops off her horse to pet the capybears. Everyone but Iskra and Arythas jump at the opportunity to pet them, and Malley pulls out some cookies. It is clear that the family is a baking family, or at least Malley is.

The family explains that the elfin king is in Oceanscar to hold court there. Rohan recalls that the king is new and he is “the Reformer” (affectionate) or “the Soulless” (derogatory). He wants to bring modernity to the realm and gave the orcs their sovereignty. He’s also brought magic and is working towards more equality.

The king will be having a party in six or so days time. We give the halfling family our spare horse and the pony so that we can ride hard to Oceanscar as we realize the corrupted wine is headed to Oceanscar for this celebration of the king. We cast enhance ability on the horses and ride hard, finally making it out along the coastline.

We make it to Oceanscar before the cart of wine does, and we begin to discuss how to handle this situation. Dia and Arythas wish to try to discuss the wine affair with the king, while Iskra tries to create some alternative solutions. They would not really be acceptable given the current context of what is going on. He does eventually suggest using purify food & drink on the carts coming into town, and Dia and Arythas find this a rather good thought and something to keep in mind to offer.

Plans:
- Dia and Arythas go to talk to the king and be reasonable
- Use Dia’s name to get in
- Lie, cheat, steal (no Rohan)
- Blow up the cart & ask forgiveness later (no Iskra)
