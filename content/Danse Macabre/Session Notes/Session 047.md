Missed session 46.

As we prepare for the party, Iskra first checks to see if there is anyone tied to his curse here, and he does not sense anyone with his curse anywhere in this town: there is no trace of Tristan here. Dia mentions that she knows someone who will be in attendance to the party. We are invited to the town hall a little earlier than the party actually begins, so we arrive.

There is someone hammering in a welcome banner - it’s a bit tacky, and the worker is quite high off the ground. We make our way in and hear a snap as the rope holding the worker up snaps, and he falls onto the roof, and then down the rest of the way. Dia goes up to check on him and his neck is broken.

The host comes out and is concerned as the guests are coming here soon and so the worker’s corpse needs to be moved, and he is glad that the banner is up. Krag speaks up and says that he will notify the next of kin and ensure the hazard pay is delivered. This was not set up beforehand, and Krag is making sure to do damage control.

Dia sneaks after where the body is taken, with Iskra there as well, and the big Major from the caravan before that is standing over the corpse in the hall. He is creepy and does not speak. His back is to Dia and Iskra, but he removes the mask over his face and stands over the body. Taking the man by the hand, he snaps the arm by the elbow, and then Dia hears a crunch after the arm is taken to his mouth. Dia grabs Iskra by the arm and books it out of there.

Everyone does very well with their performances, and then we move on to the actual party. Everything is expensive, but it’s clear the host does not know how to actually properly put things together. There’s caviar, but they don’t know how to actually store caviar in the interim. It is very important that this party goes well for the host, as many important people are here.

Dia, in her disguise, approaches her friend: a 6’5” tall woman that is furred and a cousin to the yeti. Dia enjoys talking to her to have her be nervous, then gives herself away with a specific line suggesting she wear blue. They catch up a little bit, Dia explaining her family wants her dead, and that Rafferty’s gotten an upgrade. Dia casts the spell exposition with some REDACTION about the undead so that her friend is all caught up.

Dia asks her friend about if she knows anything about the undead, and Neminna thinks about it. She responds and explains her dad got too drunk one night and spoke about the bridge in the war. She elaborates to say that they were fighting with something that ate corpses. Arythas and Dia make eye contact with each other. Her friend says that she wants to help, and Dia explains that knowing about any of this is exceedingly dangerous, and knowledge about this has the potential to rip the world apart. As Dia continues to insist that Neminna is safer the less she knows, she finally desists. She admits she would like to be able to catch up with Dia and, after an accidental mention of the bounty hunters, she says that she will do anything that she can to help us: she can arrange for us to speak to the Warden, she can give us a safe place to stay, or something more.

Dia agrees that we should speak to the Warden, and that we need to fill in the rest of the party.

Inky is busy dealing with his rival cousin, and they argue. Inky eventually calms things down and he and Zinky. They ultimately get to talking about wizard towers and basically there’s a conspiracy to sell wizard towers, and Inky chases after him to make sure that he isn’t doing anything actually negative.

Rohan looks around the party for the host, and he feels a hand on his shoulder and a voice in his ear saying that it was a wonderful performance. It is Kestrel, and Rohan hugs him. They flirt with each other in the party.
