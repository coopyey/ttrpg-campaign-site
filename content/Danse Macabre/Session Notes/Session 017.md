## Session Notes

The plan as it is:

1. Arythas and Dia will talk to the guards as holy people to try to get an audience with the king.
2. Iskra, Rohan, and Inky are going to try to sneak into the king’s chamber.
3. Cry.
4. Burn things down.

Dia approaches the guard and asks to be let in. She shows the letter of confidence and impresses the importance of her ability to get in here. One guard goes to get their supervisor.

Lore moment: The Felu
> The Felu are the losers of the wore, and man are they sore. They are incredibly patriotic and are a fascist-like movement that has risen up. They spend time preparing to ensure in the next war they will not lose. The war was under the previous king, and the new king is more practical: he’s brought magic to the people, created nationalized healthcare, etc.

Dia and Arythas stand around and wait for a little and eventually [[Captain Tavrion WIP]], the captain of the Royal Guard, comes out. They’re an elfin magma genasi (nonbinary, currently masc) that comes over to look us over. Dia explains that we have important business with the king. They review the letter of confidence as Dia explains the current situation is not suitable to speak in a public area. Dia convinces them to allow Inky, Iskra, and Rohan in to wait with us. We are led into the guardhouse. The captain kicks everyone out and sits so that we can explain what is going on in more detail.

We ultimately allow them to examine the bottle of corrupted wine and they call their sibling in to bring the king back to the palace. The captain gives us a special piece of magical bark as a deputy badge, and also a jade sending stone to communicate with them. Tavrion will send people to help the prisoners from the soiree, and we are to take care of the wine and destroy it as the guard cannot actually do anything in an official capacity because of the political landscape in Oceanscar.

Iskra sends an animal messenger to the Bloodsoaked Banner to possibly give additional aid to the people trapped from the soiree. We then head toward the city gates to stop the cart. Iskra will pretend to be lost in the middle of the road, as if his wolf has abandoned him. This works, and so Inky and Rohan go to sneak into the back of the cart while Dia goes up to the man speaking to Iskra and goes full Karen on the poor guy.

Rohan and Inky set up a candle next to a rope holding the wine together. The rope begins to burn while Inky and Rohan leave the cart, and then Inky uses control flame to make the fire expand once they’re safe. A barrel finally explodes and dusts the horses and bodies of the undead creatures pretending to be people. One of the sisters appear and stabs Kestrel in the back, beginning combat.
