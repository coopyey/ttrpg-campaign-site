We get back into the action in the middle of combat.

Shadow Creature:
- AC: 19
- Resist: Double against nonmagical effects
- Immune: Poison
- Weaknesses: None
- They have fly speed so cannot be tripped

[[Nakha]] realizes that they can't do much with regards to the damage of these shadow creatures, so they disengage to try to search for a weapon that is better against the shadow creatures. They find a gemstone that is darker than anything they've seen, and they realize that the shadows in here are bound to this place and the gem they found is connected to them. It looks like a gemstone but they think it is not actually a gemstone, it is way more brittle. There is also paired flyssa, and they are suspiciously well preserved. They decide to destroy the gem by breaking it with the flat of their knife blade, resulting in the crypt becoming lighter in general and the shadows lose some of their resistances.

We finish up this combat and many of us are feeling pretty sick thanks to the way the shadows were able to tear at our shadows, but Nakha wishes to lay down in one of the tombs. Everyone thinks this is a bad idea, with [[Corwin Sorensen]] admitting that he wasn't expecting that at all, and [[Wilhelm]] and [[Khar'rik]] both making sounds of disagreement. [[Emily]] sits down in an open area and makes a fire so that we can have some rations and rest to heal up and feel better.

[[Bertram]] dresses some of the wounds on Emily's bear, and she also gives the bear her healing potion. She finds a hunter's bow while looking around the crypt.

Bertram also notices that Khar'rik is the quite accomplished healer, which surprises him.

Nakha continues looking around finds a religious symbol that they recognize: that of Zehir, and the corpse inside the sarcophagus mutilated. They find a well-preserved vial of poison. This is a poison that iis used by followers of Zehir specifically, and it's a divine type of poison that is not particularly potent but it will actually affect the undead. They look around some more and find another one off this poison. They know that Zehir doesn't have much in the way of respect for the undead. Nakha then naps inside of a sarcophagus.

While Nakha settles in to nap, Bertram is looking around the room and doesn't seem to find what we are looking for and curses under his breath. He explains we need to go deeper into the crypt to find what we are looking for. Emily talks to him and asks if we have to go deeper and he is disappointed it has to be hard. Emily asks if he can tell us what we are looking for and he says that the Warden, [[General Chase]], is researching something. He motions to the shadows and explains that the Warden wants samples of this, and that it's difficult but possible.

He explains there are places like this with these shadows all over the mountain. There are many chapels, caves with symbols, and the like. This temple is definitely the largest structure he's seen. He's hoping to leverage this so that most of us can get out.

Emily asks what got Bertram in here and he says that he guess he was in the wrong family. Emily probes as to what that means: rob someone, sleep with the wrong boy or girl? He explains that his family is pretty weird: he gets along with two siblings: a little sister, and a brother that's his twin. Emily reminds him a lot of his little sister named Emlyn. He explains that his brother needs to do some growing up, and then explains some of the other siblings including the "psychopath" twins. 

He goes on to explain that his little sister was supposed to be married and he protested, then woke up here in the prison. He's concerned that she's run into undead creatures as well. He would like to get out and try to find her as she is the best of him and his family. He explains that he needs to get back to her because he is so concerned about what's going on and he will absolutely burn down even the mountains to get to her if he has the feeling she's in danger.

Bertram explains that the undead is back: it's not a new thing, as the undead have clearly been here for a while. Emily is unsettled by the idea of undead. The two converse a little longer, and then Bertram breaks away to address the entire group. Corwin cheats at poker and causes a general uproar.

Emily manages to find a weapon of Bahamut for Khar'rik, an old greatpick much like what he already had but a little more magically imbued.

Corwin also approaches Emily and happens to have a  healing potion that he scrounged up and gives it to her. She doesn't fully trust it so she takes it to Khar'rik to see if it's a real potion. He verifies that it is definitely a healing potion, but there is something very strange about it, and he can't figure out where Corwin got it. He simply says it will heal and gives a thumbs down (his thumbs up).

Emily offers him some food to eat and Emily notices that there are some holes in Khar'rik's armor, and Nakha hears but does not see this exchange. Khar'rik takes the food after a hum of affirmation, then walks away with the food to sit in an alcove away from the group, then takes his helmet off once he's sufficiently far away. 

Wilhelm by now sees Khar'rik taking off his helmet and Wilhelm rushes across the room and momentarily hinders Khar'rik taking his helmet off and asks what is going on, why is he taking his helmet off? Nakha casts *cloak of shadow* on Khar'rik to conceal him from light as he eats. Wilhelm backs off and sits down to eat his own food.

When Khar'rik is finished eating he walks out of the shadow as he's putting his helmet back on, and Emily catches just a glimpse of Khar'rik beneath the suit for a split second and she notices that the skin is cracked beneath the suit. He walks over to Emily, who is clearly watching him. She puts her food down, waiting for him, and he raises his arm and puts an arm towards her, and touches her shoulder, then leans in and says thank you. Out of the corner of his eye he can see that the bear has 3 eyes, and is a latticework of flesh over a frame of bone, and then Khar'rik seems to already be aware of this. He turns and walks away.

There's a scuffle over Corwin having an apple and Emily stealing it, and he asks why it is that the guy who is supposed to be crazy is okay, and Emily explains she's been in a prison for months and has finally been given a weapon again.
