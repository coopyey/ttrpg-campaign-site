Inky goes to the [[The Library Between WIP]] to study and found someone else there, though Inky doesn’t see them. Inky waits around for the other person to come forth, pretending to read. He eventually comes across a feathere Yuan-Ti. Inky is aware that the feathered type are more related to coatls and they are seperate from the evil snake-based Yuan-Ti empire. They don’t notice as Inky walks past.

Inky says hello and surprises them. They didn’t expect anyone else to be here and they introduce themself as [[Szotszi]] (shoht-shee), a blue feathered Yuan-Ti that uses she/they pronouns. Inky is curious if Szotszi sees the caretaker as another form, but they do not and wonder if the caretaker can only take on draonic forms.
