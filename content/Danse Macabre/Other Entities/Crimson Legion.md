## Additional Notes

For reference, the Crimson Legion is an organization of tieflings. They’re generally paladins and warlocks that worship varying deities of light — some worship Pelor, some Bahamut, a few worship Bane. The warlocks may have pacts with fiends that are aligned against Asmodeus. Their goal is to destroy Asmodeus, but for nwo they fight evil doers and fiends. They wish to change the king of the Hells.
