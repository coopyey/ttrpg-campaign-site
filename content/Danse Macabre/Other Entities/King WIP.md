## Other Notes

The family explains that the elfin king is in Oceanscar to hold court there. Rohan recalls that the king is new and he is “the Reformer” (affectionate) or “the Soulless” (derogatory). He wants to bring modernity to the realm and gave the orcs their sovereignty. He’s also brought magic and is working towards more equality.
