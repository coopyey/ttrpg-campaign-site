A blue dragonborn that lived isolated in the mountains between the [[Abbey of St. Cuthbert]] and [[Oceanscar]]. Some of his scales are cracked, and he holds himself like a warrior.

A legendary paladin from the war. His most famous story is that he used his power to destroy a dam and it drowned a small town. There was a magical project being developed in the town that would have caused devastation but the town wasnâ€™t evacuated so it was stopped at what cost.
