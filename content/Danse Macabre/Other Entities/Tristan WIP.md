## Other Notes

Dia and Rohan try to comfort Iskra, reassuring that it wasn’t him. The others discuss the difference between taking responsibility vs. tearing yourself down. Iskra knows who did this to him and knows they just enjoy this type of cruelty. Iskra isn’t sure he wants to see who did this to him, and he isn’t sure if they’re still doing this. Iskra has been a lycanthrope for 5 years, and he stopped aging once he contracted the curse.

Iskra explains that the man who turned him was named Tristan and he isn’t sure if Tristan is aware that he’s been cured. Tristan turns people for fun and takes enjoyment from it, but he wants to remove the curse from himself. Tristan was born with the curse and tried to remove it, but it made it worse. He’s now permanently in his lycanthrope form (as far as Iskra knows, anyway). Iskra doesn’t know how old Tristan is. Mordaine was the first person that Iskra has met that was also cursed by Tristan.
