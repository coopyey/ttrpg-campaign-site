**Aliases:**

- The Reformer
- The Soulless

The new king to [[Oceanscar]], he is labelled as the Reformer by his fans, and the Soulless by those who do not like him. He wishes to bring modernity to the realm, and gave the orcs their sovereignty. He's also making magic more accessible to everyone rather than attainable by those who can afford school.
