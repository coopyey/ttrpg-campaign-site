A man who believed he was the beginning of the upper class in [[Apamea]]. He believes that because he has money he has the power to kill whoever he wants, whenever. He attempted to kidnap [[Kalvag]] and we took care of him and his goons while [[Soldas]] retrieved Kalvag.

We saw him in [[Session 033]].
