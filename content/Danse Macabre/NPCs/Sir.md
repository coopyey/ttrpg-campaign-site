The large man from [[Cruelwind Prison]] that we saw ordering the guards around in [[Ormarsa]] on the supply run.

He is a very large man - possibly larger than Arythas' 8 foot tall stature - that appears to be human. His face was entirely wrapped up, and he did not speak, so it is hard to really know for sure. Moves and walks with a deliberate slowness, no obvious weapons on him. Clearly commands fear in the guards around him even without speaking by the way the guards acted on the supply run we witnessed.
