According to [[Iskra]], Tristan is the type who enjoys incredible cruelty. Tristan was born with this curse and tried to remove it, but it made it worse and now he's permanently in lycanthrope form (as far as Iskra is aware, anyway). 

Doesn't take to the sea very well, as according to Captain Kearney.
