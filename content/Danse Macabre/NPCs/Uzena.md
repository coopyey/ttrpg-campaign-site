**Class:** Rogue

Sister to [[Faalvi]] and [[Lohiss]].

We fought Uzena outside of [[Oceanscar]] while intercepting the cart filled with corrupted wine. She wanted to stop us so that the corrupted wine made it to the event that the [[King of Oceanscar]] was going to hold. She fought us alongside two undead minions, ultimately being arrested by [[Captain Tavrion]].
