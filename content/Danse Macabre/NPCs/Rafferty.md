**Full Name:** Rafferty Holless

[[Dia]]'s older brother.

He initially played the role of the gallant paladin, though he had no actual holy powers. Instead, he had what was essentially a gunblade: a sword of dwarven make with cartridges to simulate using smite. After being chewed out by Dia, he started to distance himself from [[The Family of Light]]  and began to walk a path of improvement.

Dia discovered that Rafferty actually writes books under the pen name R. M. Light, and appears that he seems to rather enjoy being an author.
