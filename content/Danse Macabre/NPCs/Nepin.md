**Full Name:** Nepin Ialdethish

A dragonborn woman who is middle-aged and more wiry than her husband, [[Aphen]]. They live together in [[Ormarsa]].

She was unaware of how Aphen got the name Ialdethish and Arythas has no desire to tell her and air out the history if Aphen doesn't wish for her to know. She had a suitor that she and Aphen worked to dodge, which is why they're living in Ormarsa.
