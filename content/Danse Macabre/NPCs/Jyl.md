**Full Name:** Jyl Moorman

A young woman who looks like she might be college age who was escorting a vampire on [[Professor Profundoâ€™s Railroad Circus & Casino]]. She was very concerned as the runes on the container were wearing and [[Arythas]] and [[Dia]] helped re-seal the coffin to ensure the vampire within couldn't get out. 

When asked who hired her, she would zone out for a few seconds before coming to. She was unable to provide this information entirely.

As a note, [[Vampires]] work differently in this setting.
