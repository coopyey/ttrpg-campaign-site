Freelance mercenary that has decided to take up the task of capturing [[Dia]] to return her to [[The Family of Light]] in exchange for the bounty they have put on her head. Absolute piece of work, southern cowboy wannabe motherfucker. Absolutely incompetent despite his best efforts.

Has a group of people that he works with.

>Attempting to capture Dia in [[Oceanscar]] via ambush as we walked toward the castle. Dia ran and the rest of the group stopped him through the use of command and psychic attacks. He is questioned and explains he only cares about the bounty on Dia's head and nothing more, then we essentially let him go.
