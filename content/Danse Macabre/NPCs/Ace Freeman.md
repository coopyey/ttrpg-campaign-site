>Attempting to capture Dia in [[Oceanscar]] via ambush as we walked toward the castle. Dia ran and the rest of the group stopped him through the use of command and psychic attacks. He is questioned and explains he only cares about the bounty on Dia's head and nothing more, then we essentially let him go.

[[Session 034]]
>We were on [[Professor Profundoâ€™s Railroad Circus & Casino]] on the way to [[Reclesau]] when Ace and his boys [[Stinky]] and [[Ronald Rasmussen]] thought they would try to get a one up on us. Instead, Inky pushed Ace off of the train and into the river below, which scared off Stinky and Ronald.
