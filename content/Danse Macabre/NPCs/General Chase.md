The Warden at [[Cruelwind Prison]]. Wears the old war uniform in its entirety, including the cap. A human with salt and pepper beard, older, but still handsome. An old ally of [[Soldas]].

Soldas explained that on paper he works for the ruling council of [[Reclesau]], but they have left him alone to do what he wanted with the prison. There is a rumor that *if you pay well enough, you can have someone imprisoned there,* though that has not been directly confirmed. Soldas also warns that *General Chase has changed since the end of the war,* and does not seem to be the same honorable man he once was. Soldas is not sure what would have caused this.

A frost troll that we saw as we were stopped in [[Temma]] let us know that General Chase would occasionally hunt his people for sport.

[[Aunt Betsy]] of the Barrus family of [[Ormarsa]] let slip that General Chase actually *started* Cruelwind Prison. She also explains that a mad mage ([[Kalvag]]?) killed his family.
