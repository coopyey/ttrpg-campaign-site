**Full Name:** Crawford "Ford" Barrus

A young half-elf that we met in [[Ormarsa]] that took quite a shine to [[Rohan]] while we were there. 

He is a young man that is aware that his father actually may not be a great man. He could do with a push in the right direction to move against [[Cruelwind Prison]].
