[[Rohan]]'s boyfriend. An invoker.

---

An aasimar that we met in [[Oceanscar]] at the soiree being held by [[Lady Eltun Cordon]]. He and Rohan meshed almost instantly, spending the evening flirting until Kestrel disappeared and Rohan found him tied up and seemingly beaten by someone. He asked Rohan to kill him, explaining that he would regenerate outside of the party somewhere in the upper level of Oceanscar and would be back to help.

### Invokers

These are basically like reverse sorcerers. Rather than having innate magical power, they pull their power from a dead god of some sort. Some invokers can actually regenerate after death - this cannot happen very often: perhaps once a year or something akin to that sort of timeline.
