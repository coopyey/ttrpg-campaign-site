[[Oceanscar]] nobility that we saw that the party that the [[King of Oceanscar]] was holding. A beautiful blonde elfin woman. 

Her dress was stolen by the party and presented to [[Dia]] as a well-intentioned present, but it went poorly as it was a replica for the wedding dress Dia was supposed to wear to marry [[Lord Liyon]].
