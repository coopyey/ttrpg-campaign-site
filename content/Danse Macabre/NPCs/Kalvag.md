- Kalvag the Wrath

A gentleman we originally met in the prison in the [[Abbey of St. Cuthbert]]. He is an old war criminal from [[the war]], known for killing many people on the battlefield after doing incredibly unethical experiments during wartime. He was there as penance to these crimes, and was there by his own volition until we arrived and convinced him to leave.

He is knowledgeable about the experiments surrounding death during the war, though he is uncertain how to stop necromancy. There were control mechanisms that were theorized, and without those safeguards he isn't sure how one would actually control the undead.
