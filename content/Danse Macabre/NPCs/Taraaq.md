Rohan's "case manager" in the patron business.

Part of a group of fiends that work under a larger patron as case managers for mortals who strike deals. He was once an ifrit and is now a demon. Wishes to ascend and be free of this place. [[Phoebe]] has confirmed to Iskra that ascension *is possible and has actually happened before*.

**Rohan Knows:**
>Taraaq was a young ifrit that disagreed with his father, the sultan, on something. The sultan himself is an older gentleman that is looking down at Taraaq with sadness on his face, saying there is no other way. Taraaq says that he knows of another way, and the next thing Rohan sees is Taraaq as a demon chained up. He's then sitting in a cubicle, owned by some greater demon, working in a life that is no longer his own.
