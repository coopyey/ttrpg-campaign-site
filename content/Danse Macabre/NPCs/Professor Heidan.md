**Full Name**: Heidan Farstar

We met him in [[Oceanscar]] while escaping the soiree held by [[Lady Eltun Cordon]].

An older elf that writes adventuring 101 type books, popular 1-2 generations behind us. (Think Volo.) He hasn't published any new work in a while.

He acts very self-important and is generally incompetent and a not so pleasant guy to be around. He was traveling with the dwarf [[Famir]], and a ranger.
