**Full Name:** Caoimhe Kearney

A woman that we met in [[Oceanscar]] at the soiree thrown by [[Lady Eltun Cordon]].

A red-headed woman that appears to be human, though [[Iskra]] knows she is a seawolf werewolf, that is a captain of the ship named the [[Sea Bitch]]. She is absolutely a pirate. She has no desire to get rid of her lycanthropy curse, finding that she actually rather likes it and finds it empowering.
