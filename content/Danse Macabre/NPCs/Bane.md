God of war. Lawful. He has bronze (the metal) skin, and burning eyes that glow but are deep within his helm.

His armies have fought eldritch creatures, things foreign and that could unravel the material plane should they reach there. The armies are well-trained against these types of creatures, and Bane has fought alongside [[Bahamut]] many times.
