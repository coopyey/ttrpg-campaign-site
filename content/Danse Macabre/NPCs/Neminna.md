A 6'5" tall woman that has fur and who's ancestry is a cousin to the yeti. She is a princess and personal friend of [[Dia]]'s.

She very much wants to help us in chasing down and dealing with this undead threat. After Dia tried to talk her out of it quite a bit, she insisted, and we agreed to allow her to set up a chat with the Warden of [[Cruelwind Prison]]. She also leaves having a safe place to hide on the table, but we'll see what happens.
