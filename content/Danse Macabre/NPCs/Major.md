We saw him at the party that was being held with [[General Chase]] of [[Cruelwind Prison]] invited. He was seen by [[Dia]] eating the corpse of the man who died outside of the  burgomaster's estate. Picked up [[Iskra]] after he fell and seems to like soft things. Iskra noticed that *he does have a pulse,* but it is very slow.
