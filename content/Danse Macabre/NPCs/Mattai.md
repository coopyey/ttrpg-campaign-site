The mysterious librarian of [[The Library Between]]. She takes the form of a kobold, but is clearly incredibly powerful.

[[Bane]] referred to her and The Library Between as "the belly of the beast". [[Bahamut]] has also advised Arythas that Inky has those that aren't good company around him - I (the player) assume that Mattai was the reference for this.
