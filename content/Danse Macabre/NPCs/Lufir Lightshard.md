*Who even is this kid?* - Me, too afraid to ask who this kid is after being absent a session

A young man that we met in [[Oceanscar]] at the soiree being thrown by [[Lady Eltun Cordon]]. 

He was originally quite disturbed, believing himself to be some sort of orcish messiah despite being an elf? Half elf? Definitely not an orc.
