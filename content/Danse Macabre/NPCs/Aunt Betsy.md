Part of the Barrus family of [[Ormarsa]]. 

We first ran into her when invited to dinner with the Barrus family by the kid, [[Ford]] and his mother [[Bitsy]]. Aunt Betsy put on a show pretending to be more drunk than she was, and Dia spoke to her about the prison. 

She seemed to believe that the prison itself was cursed, and lets slip that [[General Chase]] changed while in charge of the prison and that he was not the same man as he was directly after the war. She also let slip that General Chase *started* [[Cruelwind Prison]]. She also let slip that a mad mage killed his family.

Additionally, she offers to lend us her aid. She *can get us all into the prison* either by drumming up fake charges, or taking us as her entourage to visit the general, and she can get us an invite to the party that the general will be at.
