**Full Name:** Aphen Ialdethish

A middle-aged silver dragonborn that is on the bigger side. Married to [[Nepin]]. They live together in [[Ormarsa]]. He has a son [[Nilmuk]].

When he was a young man he made mistakes and had debts that he could not pay. When the debt collectors finally came, [[Arnas]] Ialdethish gave him some assets to pay off his debt, as well as allowed him to change his last name to the Ialdethish name with the caveat that he had to live up to the name. He is not actually related to [[Arythas]], just a stranger given his name and a second chance by Arnas.

It was within Arythas' right to strike Aphen down if he so wished. Arythas chose not to do so, opting instead to brace this opportunity of a family after thinking he'd lost everyone.
