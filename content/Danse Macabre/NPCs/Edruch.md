The Orc we met in [[Usval]] in [[Arcfort]] that is a scholar and attempting to build the culture of their new nation. He is clearly attempting to learn the social norms of other countries and figure out what should be incorporated into the new nation, and what they can go without. He is also attempting to create an Orcish alphabet so that the Orcs can have their own language.

In the museum of culture, we found out that there were bog mummies that were preserved that he was using to try to recover the culture that would have otherwise been lost. They're undead and can't seem to actually speak in normal. He tried to defend this collection of undead by saying that if they don't build the culture, history, and perspective, then the fascists will win, and what better way to do that than these souls?
