Fey lord that is attuned with the earth, and uncle of the [[Frosty Princess Glaciebella]]. 

A jovial creature that lives in the depths of the earth and enjoys trapping adventurers and other beings deep in the earth in mazes to feed off of their fear and anguish. Was very grateful we helped his niece and let us out of the undercity of [[Oceanscar]] so that we could continue on our quest. We are aware that he has since left Oceanscar because he has grown bored there, and is somewhere far away finding his amusement.
