The human man in his late 40s+ that was intended to marry [[Dia]]. A man of some importance, it is best not to dig into or delve too deep into his affairs as there is a reputation of people disappearing for doing so. He appears to be someone that hoards knowledge of some sort, though it is not known to us what. We all know that he is not a pleasant man.

He previously fought in the war, but his official history was scrubbed for unknown reasons. Hhe is a wealthy and powerful individual that is not from the region around [[Oceanscar]]. His influence is somewhere far off, and his own lands are considered lawless. He is a very secretive man.

The match between him an Dia does not make sense, even with regards to collecting power for [[The Family of Light]]. Dia is aware that this man is not her father's first choice, and she herself is confused because [[Prudence]] would be a better match for him.

He was "married" to Dia in a false ceremony where a young woman was enchanted to look like Dia. Dia suspects that he is not even aware that the young woman he is married to is a double and not actually Dia.
