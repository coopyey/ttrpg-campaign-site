**Ancestry:** [[Shiradi]] (basically an angel)

[[Bahamut]] labeled her as one of Samhain's people.

The woman that cured [[Iskra]] of his lycanthropy. She cures others when she can, though there is something limiting her capability. Her first job is to help those that [[Tristan]] hurt. She admits that her family is not a fan of her reaching out to mortals, but she also admits she can't leave well enough alone.

She's a very sweet person who is nice, curing people just because she can. She has a certain level of power as she was able to visit Iskra in his dreams, though she is not very careful: she also threw wide the gates for others to visit us in our dreams as well, which was a vulnerability.
