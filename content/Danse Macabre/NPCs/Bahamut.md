The chromatic dragon, and the main good deity of the draconic pantheon. His main concern is justice tempered with mercy, but he also has fought against [[Nerull]] and other evil deities.

He visited [[Arythas]] in his dreams in [[content/Danse Macabre/Session Notes/Session 025|Session 025]] and advised that he keep an eye on Inky because Inky has some bad company around him. He also recommended to Arythas that too much anger can cause him to lash out and hurt those around him, and you can't always pick your companions. He also explains that sometimes paladins smite evil, sometimes they are there to help people be their best selves. Arythas needs to search for the best in people rather than pick at the worst parts of them.
