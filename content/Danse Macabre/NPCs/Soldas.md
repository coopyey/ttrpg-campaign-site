Elfin leader of the [[Bloodsoaked Banner]]. Slav. Covered in scars. Tired and put it with it all.

Knows who gave Dia her headband, warning her not to take it off.

We realize that he reincarnates: he is reborn with memories of his previous lives, and the scars of his past lives on his body as well.
