Elfin leader of the [[Bloodsoaked Banner]]. Slav. Covered in scars. Tired and put it with it all. We realize that he reincarnates: he is reborn with memories of his previous lives, and the scars of his past lives on his body as well.

Knows who gave Dia her headband, warning her not to take it off.

In [[Session 040]] we learned that Soldas had a very active part in the war: he led a taskforce that used a specific, highly destructive weapon. It was used only once and then never again. We think that it was used to *stop* the undead in [[Amoth Bridge]], but it is hard to know for sure if it was to stop the undead or to create them.
