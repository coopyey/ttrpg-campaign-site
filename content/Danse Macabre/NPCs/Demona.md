Works with [[Taraaq]] and occasionally takes over giving advice when he is out. Maintains the party's communication "sending" network (through our jewelry).

She was previously an angel that has fallen. She is part of the group of fiends that that works under a patron as a "case" manager for mortals, of sorts. She would like to get out and ascend.
