## The Mission

An organization of tieflings who have the goal of killing Asomdeus and changing the king of the Hells. While they work towards this, they also fight evil-doers and fiends.

## Additional Notes

The Crimson Legion is an organization of tieflings. They’re generally paladins and warlocks that worship varying deities of light — some worship Pelor, some [[Bahamut]], a few worship [[Bane]]. The warlocks may have pacts with fiends that are aligned against Asmodeus.
