**Full Name:** Arnas Ialdethish

[[Arythas]]'s late grandfather. Arythas is the spitting image of him.

Was described by [[Aphen]] as a very good judge, and very good to the people he presided over. He was particularly good about people that he deemed worthy of assistance. He would give those who he felt deserved it a second chance at life, affording them opportunities to rebuild and move on. This is what he did for Aphen.
