As undead is a new thing in this world, vampires work a little differently. They are fiends or demons that possess a body as a way to get onto and interact with the material plane without a having to have a powerful demon lord protect them.

Unless they are incredibly powerful, they must still follow traditional vampire rules such as staying out of the sunlight. If a vampire is so powerful it can ignore those rules then it is a real mcfucking problem.
