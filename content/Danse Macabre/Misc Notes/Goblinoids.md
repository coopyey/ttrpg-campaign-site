Goblins and related heritages are also a little bit different in this setting as well. They are all contained within the [[Goblin Empire]]. 

Goblins have a particularly mutable genome that allows for them to have variations basically built to order based on the properties of other beings and creatures. New types of goblins are still considered people with full rights, and are not treated any differently than the types of goblins that we are familiar with. The creation of new types of goblins is done through alchemy-based magic through a rather scientific method.

Similarly, goblins can also use alchemy-based science to regenerate entire limbs that were lost in battle, a workplace accident, or through a battle.
