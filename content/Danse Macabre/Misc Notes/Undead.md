In this setting, undeath is not a given. While there has been some theoretical conversation about it on paper, there has never really been a practical application of it and undeath is considered a festering wound upon the world. It is unnatural. Because of this magics such as necromancy are not fields of study and do not exist at this time.

### Undead Information

Wherever there is undead, [[Nerull]] is nearby whether by chant or by energy. It is thought that this is all connected to the dead god.

Nerull is the reason that undead cannot be controlled: he takes control of them and overrides mortal methods of restraint.

[[Dia]] explained that the best way to deal with the undead is with **holy fire** or **holy light**. 

[[Ilxavar]] also mentioned that there are old parts of the [[Goblin Empire]] that would need to be reactivated with the looming threat of undeath.
