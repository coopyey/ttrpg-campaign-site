[[Session 036]]
>A group of frost trolls disappeared almost 19 winters ago during the war and nobody could explain it. It's possible that they were abducted to be experimented on, or that they perhaps roamed near [[Amoth Bridge]]. The trolls killed hundreds before disappearing, and the city of Amoth Bridge disappeared after the massacre.
