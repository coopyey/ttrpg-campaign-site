Name of the new Orc nation that was created when Orcs were granted sovereignty by the [[King of Oceanscar]].

The primary citizens are orcs and gnolls. It is definitely a country that is being built: infrastructure is not yet built out, and there is not much in the way of culture outside of peacocking and trying to prove you're the ~~prettiest girl at the ball~~ toughest guy on the street.

The leader of the country has the title of General.
