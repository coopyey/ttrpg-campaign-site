Also known as the *City of Peace*.

A city that was built as an experiment and now everyone has to live with the consequences therein. It was an experiment that was not particularly effective. Dia's father, the leader of [[The Family of Light]], was upset that he could not gain a foothold here in the city.

The experiment was done by the [[Priesthood of Erathis]]. They thought that people went to war because they did not spend enough time together to get to know each other. They teleported pieces of different cities from different peoples and cultures and put them together in one large patchwork city. The city pieces are representative of elf, orc, hobgoblin, and dwarves (the dwarven quarter is underground). The population is more diverse. There is a distinct lack of guards in the city, and it primarily run by differing gangs in the city.
