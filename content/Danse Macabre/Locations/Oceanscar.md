The city where the corrupted wine from the [[Abbey of St. Cuthbert]] was headed. Located on the coast. 

Previously a dwarven city, half of the city actually exists underground. The king's palace and all of the noble quarters, for example, are below. The elves who took over the city preserved all of the original architecture that still held purpose, including some of the abandoned buildings that vacated once the orcs all left. The harbor is built into the cliffside so that the shipyard is essentially underground, and there is an upper harbor for airships to come, dock, and leave. The population is primarily elves, but there's still a solid mix. About a million people here in total.

The city is named as it is built on a jagged cliff above the ocean. There is a legend that the cliff was formed when the gods cleaved the land and the ocean filled the space between.
