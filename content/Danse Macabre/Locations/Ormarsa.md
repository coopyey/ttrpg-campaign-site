Capital of [[Reclesau]].

A small city despite being a capital. The city sort of slumps next to a pale river. There is a town hall that houses the town leader and his family, and a clocktower towards the center of town. The city itself is pretty dour and there are not many people on the street, though we have arrived in the middle of the day so people may be working.

There is a prince and a royal family, but they are far less important than the leader of the town., and they live elsewhere in their ancestral lands and their castle. 

The leader of Ormarsa has connection to [[Cruelwind Prison]].
