**True Name:** Kroilâ€™vend

**Warden:** [[General Chase]]

Previously a fort, this is now a prison in the far north country. It is incredibly bitter and harsh and uses prisoners essentially as free slave labor. People who end up in Cruelwind often were arrested falsely, and even those that were not do not necessarily deserve to exist in this place. The prison is also known to keep *citizens of other countries*, which is incredibly illegal, but still happens.

The prison is at over capacity so there is not enough room for people to sleep out of the elements, food can be rough, and people either live or they do not. If they die then it is not any large loss.
