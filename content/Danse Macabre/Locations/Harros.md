A city in the country of **REDACTED**.

We discovered that this town participates in what we consider a perverted worship of the goddess Melora. Melora is a nature goddess with domains over the wilderness and the sea. Their practices are certainly considered fringe.

While we were there we witnessed a sentencing of criminals charged of various crimes. [[Judge Orus]] explained that the rules of man had been broken, so these criminals were to be treated as animals. We witnessed the criminals' heads polymorph into malformed wolves heads, and the Judge proclaimed that they were no longer people. They then released the criminals to run and try to find freedom, but the reality is they were to be hunted down like wolves.
