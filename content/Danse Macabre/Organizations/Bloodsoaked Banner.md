## The Mission

This is a group of veterans from the war. They are a renegade group that hunts down supernatural things such as werewolves, vampires, and the like. They also often act as security and peacekeepers in tense situations, as well as a acting as mercs to help others.

## Additional Notes

This is a pretty intense group that specializes in hunting down the supernatural. Despite being rough around the edges, they wish to do good. They are definitely not a well-loved group, but because of their reputation to generally do good they are tolerated in most places.
