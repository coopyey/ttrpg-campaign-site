### Additional Notes

Has been in [[Cruelwind Prison]] the longest, and is the only one of the alt party that has actually committed a crime. They killed their father in cold blood and then was shipped off to a local prison. They were passed around from prison to prison until they were shipped off to Cruelwind. Their behavior is erratic: sometimes they are willing to talk to people, sometimes they are not.

Pair of twins that were conjoined in the womb, the two of them share one body. Notably, there are two tails, which each of the twins independently control. They easily swap between which one fronts.

They are the only one of [[Bertram]]'s group that has committed an actual real crime. They have a strong desire to kill, and desires to kill anyone who takes living for granted.
