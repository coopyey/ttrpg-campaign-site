### Additional Notes

He emerged in the frigid north after leaving the earth. There was a misunderstanding which snowballed into him ending up here in the prison. He has to live in a containment suit so the harsh winter isn't quite as rough on him, but he has other difficulties.

Does not speak very much. Is very strong, working to break rocks with a pickaxe.
