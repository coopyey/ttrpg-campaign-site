## Personality

Arythas puts on the airs of a stoic man, but he is really an ill-tempered man who has allowed the tragedy of his life to harden him rather than seek comfort and vulnerability. What should have taught him empathy and compassion taught him instead to harden his heart and close off from most others. Blunt, direct, and with little patience for bullshit, he took up arms and continued his way as a knight, though he has strayed from the path as his views had grown black and white instead of recognizing the shades of grey that exist.

### Strengths

- Very disinclined to be swayed to a truly evil path
- Refuses to lie
- Is very direct

### Weaknesses

- Refuses to lie
- Will not spare your feelings
- Sees things in a very black and white manner
