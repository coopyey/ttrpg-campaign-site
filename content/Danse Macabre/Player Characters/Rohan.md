**Background:** 

### Additional Notes

**Full Name:** Rohan Jagger Corvo

**Patron Case Manager:** [[Taraaq]]

Has a baby face, very red eyes.

It has come out that Rohan was raised as an orphan and he assumed his parents were gone, but he is realizing that his family might still be out there. He was raised in a cult of some sort, thinking that it was a normal thing until he realized that he had magic and a connection to Taraaq. He was raised with other children, yes, and Taraaq tells him *the other children are dead*. Unlike [[Pratima]], he never seemed to have a seal placed over his heart.

It is entirely possible that his father is an actual demon lord.
