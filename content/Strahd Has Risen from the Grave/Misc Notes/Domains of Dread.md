The Domains of Dread, sometimes collectively known as the Demiplane of Dread or Ravenloft,

It has been stated that the Domains of Dread are Hell, but not for us: specially designed Hells for specific people. Some scholars say that they are not Hells but rather events: those that have happened, what is happening, what will happen. Strahd's plane is one such domain: he must live with the Hell that his love will never accept him. She is always reincarnated as no soul can leave Borovia, but Strahd also has his own loop as adventurers always visit and kill him. He's alive, dying, dead, undead. Right now he is dead.
