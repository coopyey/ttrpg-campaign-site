## General Information

**Age**: 21

**Background**: Sage

**Feature:** When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

**Height**: 5’8”

**Eyes**: Dark green

**Hair Tendril Style**: Fins, also long and goes back

**Scale Color**: Black, with a turquoise glint due to his patron

**Build**: Muscular in a working way

He no longer wears leathers, preferring instead to wear traveling clothes that are lightweight and allow for ease of movement. His longsword is also gone, replaced with the spellbook that is shown. His book was previously Honoria’s own spellbook, which he took and performed the appropriate ritual to convert into his book of shadow from his patron.

His raven is a celestial raven that carries with it the faint smell of incense. It is a black bird with golden tipped feathers to mark it a familiar. It’s name is Siobahn.

        - Choose ritual spells. They do not count against known spells. You can only cast these as rituals unless you’ve learned them some other way, such as being a wizard. You can also cast warlock spells that you know as rituals if they have the ritual tag. You can add more ritual spells as long as they are less than half your level (rounded up) for 2 hours/spell level + 50gp/spell level.

            - Detect Magic
            - Find Familiar
            - Identify
- Pact Boon: Tome
    
    Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s cantrips (the three needn’t be from the same list). While this book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.
    
    Chosen spells:
    
    - Vicious Mockery
    - Friends
    - Dancing Lights
- Feats
    - War Caster
        - Advantage on CON saves to maintain concentration.
        - As a reaction, you may cast a spell instead of taking an opportunity attack.
## Personality

**Trait**: I’m used to helping out those who aren’t as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others. There’s nothing I like more than a good mystery.

**Ideal**: Knowledge. The path to power and self-improvement is through knowledge.

**Bond**: I sold my soul for knowledge. I hope to do great deeds to win it back.

**Flaw**: I am easily distracted by the promise of information.
## History

Grew up in Compass Tor, the second-largest of the islands and most pleasant due to the highland meadow climate. It is known for its sheep as well as lodestone and iron mining operations. My family was into iron mining and, growing up, I was also in on this business. I spent my spare time reading as many books as I could and studying magic, however, as dragonborn were supposed to have a natural aptitude for it.

Studying hard, I eventually managed to catch the eye of the Marquis Petra of Stepstone, who was known for sponsoring young and aspiring mages. She paid form e to go to the school of Divination magic. I excelled in ritual casting but that was about it, eventually dropping out. As far as Petra knows I am taking private lessons. She is suspicious, but none the wiser that I managed to contact Fayruz and make a deal with the slumbering old god.

I must pay off my debt, however, which is where the adventure starts.

You begin on a boat ferrying you to Skerry Yayek, a small, rocky island with a village of about a hundred. Duchess Bellicent Le Bruin called you together to investigate why the island is incommunicado and what happened to her three tax collectors. If possible, collect the taxes as well, but find the tax collectors is the big one. Skerry Yayeg is best known for its guano mine, which supplies almost 30% of the fireball reagents in the kingdom.
