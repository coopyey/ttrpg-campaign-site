We all have water breathing.

As a reminder of the map:
![[content/assets/step_dread-one_chamber2.webp]]
There is no practical way out of chamber 2.

Inside chamber 3 is a softball size sphere of gold and several bottles and 6 or 7 vials laying in the sand.
![[step_dread-one_chamber3.webp]]
We all think about if there are any arcane artifacts that look like spheres of gold to see if we know. [[Charity]] and [[Ships]] know that this looks like a *drift globe* - they can be made to light up, and then vocally telekinetically move. It's basically dancing lights in physical form. 

When the fish swims forward after casting identify, it bounces off an invisible barrier. Because it had a ritual identify up on it and it touched the barrier, [[Calthel]] knows this is an underwater force barrier the equivalent of *arcane lock*. The password is used and then we use another 11 minutes to identify the globe and learn the activation code: the word for *gold* in Abyssal. Calthel uses his familiar to command the globe all the way back to the party so that they can retrieve it before going back down under the water. On the way back something attacks the fishy familiar and it dies below:

Water entry order: [[Sarras]] first, followed by Charity, then Calthel (after casting *dancing lights*), then Ships. 

Sarras enters the water and combat begins. We all see pretty swirling colors and the pretty colors are our friend and tell us to get into the water as fast as possible. Sarras is being dragged away by something not made by pretty colors but he also intuitively senses is his friend.

Useful Sim does his best to redirect the flow of the water. Sarras and the Dread One begin to fight against the current, spitting Ships and Calthel out of the water as well. The dread one teleports with Sarras further down the corridor.

Ships knows that if Useful Sim were to change the control water command to part water instead of redirect water then he could easily make it to line of sight to Sarras with a dash move. Pretty much the entire fjord drains of water, so Ships hops down into the hole and rushes to where Sarras is and casts firebolt on The Dread One, which misses.

Combat continues and we absolutely tear into The Dread one, so it dispels Useful Sim's use of control water. Combat continues after the water crashes down, and *Calthel casts eldritch blast,* which Sarras notices and recognizes, but there are ways to get the spell without being a warlock.

As we continue to fight, it eventually mist steps away and up the corridor to where it is halo'd by a strange green energy:

(Calthel has been changed to a grey circle with teal outline, as opposed to the previous grey circle with black outline.)

Charity goes to move up toward the Dread One, but notices something that nobody else has noticed quite yet:
![[step_dread-one_charity-noticed.webp]]
There is a Chuul hanging out beyond Best Largest. It attempts to attack the mount, but it misses. Combat continues, and Sarras and Ships eventually get dragged into the greenish energy in the water. It is noxious water, and
