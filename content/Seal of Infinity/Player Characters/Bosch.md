# Other Notes
Will sneak away form very boring conversations. Has the interesting ability to make a weapon out of anything around him, and has sticky enough fingers that he happens to have the things we need when we need them, by chance.

Was absolutely offered the option to be a deputy sheriff of [[Rosevale]] by [[The Sheriff]] who 100% thinks that Bosch is a 100% law-abiding citizen. (Ha!) He ultimately turns this opportunity down.

In [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 014|Session 014]] it is uncovered that Bosch thinks that being undead would be pretty boring, and he hates the idea that if he had to do anything commanded to him without an argument sounds awful. As it stands, he has no plans on joining the [[Kincaid]] legion.

In [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 034|Session 034]] Bosch admits that he was often given the job of distracting others in his time in the criminal underworld.
