## Mission/Goal
To exist in peace outside of the petty squabbles of [[Brex Grana]].
## Other Notes
A gang that exists in the sewers and further below [[Brex Grana]]. 

While primarily scavengers of the dinosaurs that have already died beneath the earth, due to particularly hard times, a handful of them tried their hand at poaching them and found that they were generally unable to do so. 

There's a general level of ineptitude with this group that is somewhat endearing.
