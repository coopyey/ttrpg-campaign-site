## Mission/Goal
Create order among the citizens of Brex Grana and make sure everyone has a proper place in the city to restore order and bring this political upset over the changeling prince and other divisions among the city to heel.
## Other Notes
Werewolf gang in [[Brex Grana]] led by Garm [[Clapperclaw]]. The true goal was to overthrow [[Grandfather Walker]] and take over control of the werewolves of Brex Grana.

A gang that was put together in order to amass power so that a war could be set off between the two factions of the werewolves in Brex Grana. It was heavily implied that Garm Clapperclaw was creating more members during leading up to what he hoped would be all out war to get rid of the Walker family.

In theory, this faction was brought to heel after we took care of everything in the city.
