## Mission/Goal
Create order among the citizens of [[Brex Grana]], especially among the werewolves of the city. It provides some protection for the lesser advantaged peoples of the city. Also (obviously) has ties to the criminal underbelly of the city.
## Other Notes
Run by [[Grandfather Walker]] and to be passed on to his granddaughter [[Bobbi]] Walker when the time comes. It is a werewolf gang that seems to mostly be concerned with keeping the underbelly of the city under heel, while also keeping tabs of the werewolves in the city. They appear to offer some protection and some level of social services for the poorer parts of society as well.

Garm [[Clapperclaw]], a lower ranking member of the Blue Fang, were trying to overthrow Grandfather Walker and his family for control of this gang. He had claimed that the Walker family was growing stagnant, and that he had new ideas and would bring innovation to the organization.
