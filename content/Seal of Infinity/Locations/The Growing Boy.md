An inn in the [[Verdant Core]] that has a dwarven innkeep and a gnomish cook. Most of the patrons are dwarves or gnomes and are transient in some nature, be it travelers headed elsewhere in the Hollow World, or traders. Of note: *they serve gin here*. 

The innkeep here explained to us that the locals here work more off of favors and bartering, but here at The Growing Boy they will take regular money and convert that over for the locals should we wish to buy anything or do dealings with the locals.

It is very clear that [[Montego]] is not known by anyone here. The innkeep also explains that there is not much known about the case for [[Axamonar]] except that the wizard in question really does have excellent abs.
