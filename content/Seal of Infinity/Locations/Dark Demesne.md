**Pronounced:** Dark Domain

A strange island that appeared across the sea. Nobody has been able to make contact with the denizens there.

The creatures seen thus far appear to be *wounds upon the very world* and are incredibly difficult to perceive, mostly seeming to appear as mental static rather than something that our brains can properly parse.

>Reality had seemed to split open as static poured out and approached the train with a thundering noise. It lumbered toward the train and its very presence made the glass of the observation deck crack. It was lured toward the piece of the [[Seal of Infinity]] that was being transported.

>We fought a creature and four smaller "glitches" outside of a mansion in [[Brex Grana]]. The creatures seemed to desperately wish to exist in the universe and be real, while they very clearly do not.
