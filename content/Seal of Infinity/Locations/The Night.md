Nightclub owned and operated by Garm [[Clapperclaw]] that is situated halfway between the lower and upper markets of [[Brex Grana]]. It is built out of stone and is a new build, not quite open to guests when we were in the city. This is not a club that is intended to cater to only werewolves and was to be opened to the entire population of Brex Grana, employing anyone who just needed a job or those trying to get as close to stardom as they could.

It was here that Taletha and Kevin listened in on a conversation between Clapperclaw and the wizard that turned out to be a denizen of the [[Dark Demesne]] disguised as a wizard.
