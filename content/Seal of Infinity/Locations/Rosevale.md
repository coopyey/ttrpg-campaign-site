A city complete with a train station.

When we came upon this city there were people camping outside of the walls hoping to be let in as entrance to the city was closed. [[The Sheriff]] explained that they were having an issue with people being possessed, cause mischief, then return to normal. It's an overall chaotic situation and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason, nor any particular pattern.

We figure out that it is an akizendri - not a particularly powerful protean, but annoying. They like to change the text in books. We also ran into an axiomite here as well that... Sort of assisted.
