A city in the Hollow World below the streets of [[Brex Grana]]. It is teeming with life: all types of Arboreals such as creatures that look like treeants, dryads, leshys of all shapes and sizes, Ghorans, and wood giants. While all of the natives are plant-based creatures, there are also plenty of outsiders such as dwarves and gnomes that are down here for trade. The foreigners mostly congregate in the section of the city that was clearly built by them: a quarter made of stone buildings, rather than plants grown into the shape of buildings.
