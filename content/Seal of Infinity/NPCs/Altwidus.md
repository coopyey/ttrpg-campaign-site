**Full Name:** Altwidus Changestaff

A lawyer down in the Hollow World in the [[Verdant Core]] that was the prosecutor against Sage [[Axamonar]] in the phony trial that was created to waste the Sage's time.

He is a craggly, jovial arboreal that seems to be kind but has an edge to him (we assume because he's a lawyer). He is very experienced in his job and very good at it as well. It was incredibly clear to us that he did not personally believe in the charges that Axamonar were facing and he didn't believe in the case he was fighting, but he was clearly being paid enough in some form that he was willing to do this job regardless.
