**Full Name:** Montego Larousse

A dwarf man with a red bushy beard that initially pretended to be nothing more than a simple traveler on his way to [[Brex Grana]], but turned out to be an agent of [[Clapperclaw]] that was sent there to ensure we helped [[Tasha]] get out of the prison in the [[Verdant Core]]. 

We heavily recommended that he defect from Clapperclaw and leave things before the war broke out between the two werewolf factions.
