**Title:** Guard Captain

**Full Name:** Idwal Ram

Corrupt guard captain in [[Brex Grana]], a real piece of work. He sold out to Garm [[Clapperclaw]] and he and his entire unit of guards worked to advance his agenda. Was also tight with [[Ephiny]] Lunt, who he referred to as Agent Bryce.

He tried to bully us into ceasing our meddling in the werewolf war and the search for the [[Seal of Infinity]] but he turned out to be as impotent as his morals.
