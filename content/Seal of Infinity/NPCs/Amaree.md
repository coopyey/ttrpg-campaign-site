**Title:** Lieutenant Guard

**Full Name:** Amaree Bloodwim

A young woman that was sent out to investigate the demise of Guard Captain [[Idwal]] Ram. We lied to her and said that there was a fight outside and mind control magic involved, so people got confused and then left. [[Faylen]] had a beautiful, phony lecture about magic and the theory behind how it works, and successfully managed to throw her off of our scent.
