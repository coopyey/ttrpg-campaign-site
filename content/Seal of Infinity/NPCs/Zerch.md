**Full Name:** Zerch Zilardo

A goblin that [[Bosch]] has worked with in the past, the roguish, thief type. He had changed since Bosh had last seen him, clearly doing much better for himself and wearing heavy perfumes. He wanted to have Bosch join his merry band and by the end of it all, Bosch realized that he and his cronies were undead, likely working for [[Kincaid]]. 

We presumably killed him in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 015|Session 015]].
