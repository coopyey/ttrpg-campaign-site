The shadow dragon that sent a wispling to attack the hobgoblin encampment that we found in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 002|Session 002]] that was cutting down magical trees. He is looking to collect his dues for the Bravegut bloodline that has been cursed. 

People who can be targets include:
- Sedo
	- A coward
	- Deceased
- Arkig
	- Descended from a famous hobgoblin strategist
- Kaydi
	- Descnded from Pradam the Patriarch
- Pavlar
	- The final descendent of the great king of the hobgoblins

Faylen had a meeting with his butler, [[Challender]] in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 018|Session 018]] and learned that he was growing weary of the situation in [[Brex Grana]] involving the creature that had a piece of the [[Seal of Infinity]] that was lurking about and under the employ of Garm [[Clapperclaw]], which we finally took care of in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 032|Session 032]]. This meeting also came with a warning that should Faylen receive more information from Kaymanth, he will be bound to Kaymanth's domain even more.
