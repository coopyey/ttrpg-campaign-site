The leshy that was sent from the [[Verdant Core]] to [[Brex Grana]] to retrieve the party so that Sage [[Axamonar]] could go on trial for the crime of killing himself and thus not being himself.

Florian himself was an interesting little fellow that did not know much in the ways of the surface world and conversations with him were quite interesting. We learned a lot about leshy lifestyle just as much as Florian learned about how the people of the surface live.
