Butler to [[Kaymanth]]. A previous dean of the academy that [[Faylen]] is going to school. He previously vanished under mysterious circumstances, but it was not entirely unusual given that he's a wizard, so it was never thoroughly investigated. He was previously an adventurer that didn't like taking orders and was fiery, so they made him a dean so that he would quit causing problems.

When Faylen met with Challender in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 018|Session 018]], he warned Faylen that if Faylen asks for too much help from Kaymanth, he will be bound to this plane. It's what happened to him, and now he's stuck here as Kaymanth's butler.
