A hobgoblin commander of the outpost of hobgoblins that we found when helping a group of fae. They were cutting down the magic trees in the area thinking they could use the wood of these trees to create magical weapons, to which we explain that this isn't how it works, and the fae need these trees to live, so please stop.
