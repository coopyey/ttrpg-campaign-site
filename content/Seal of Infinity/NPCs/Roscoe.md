**Full Name:** Roscoe Birthwort

A lawyer down in the Hollow World in the [[Verdant Core]] that was the lead defense lawyer to defend Sage [[Axamonar]] in the phony trial that was created to waste the Sage's time.

This was literally his first case and he was completely set up to lose. A complete nervous wreck.
