**Full Name:** Crawforde Delafontaine

A bombastic man that we ran into on the train from [[Rosevale]] to [[Brex Grana]]. He is a famous adventurer that made his name by going to the ruin of a forgotten empire and retrieving some sort of important artifact. The following stunt is his attempt to make his name big again.

He boasted that he has the [[Seal of Infinity]] in order to gain attention, and is a master of speaking without saying a single thing. With some prying from Tabby, we figured out that his understanding of the events was inaccurate. He was carrying around a piece of string, not a piece of the Seal, but he genuinely thought the piece of string was the Seal - someone had placed a spell on his mind to alter his memories and the truth of the situation.
