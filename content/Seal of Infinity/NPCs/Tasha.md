**Full Name:** Tasha Zimm

The human werewolf being held in the [[Verdant Core]] that we were tasked by [[Clapperclaw]] to release. She is a beautiful woman with dark hair and, when we met her, wore elegant adventuring-appropriate clothing.

She explained to us that we would not be able to get her out of her sentencing at court as she was absolutely guilty of what she was being charged, so she asked us to help her gather the materials she needed to complete a teleportation spell so that she could escape her charges and be free again. In exchange, she would be willing to do a favor for us.

In our conversations with her, it was obvious that she is an opportunist, and very predatory. She has a strong sense of honor, though, if only in the way that she absolutely refuses to be in debt to anyone at all. She also remains loyal to someone as long as it suits her own interests.
