**Full Name:** Danny "Lord Darkrose" Shrug

The mysterious man at the center of [[Halfdown]].

It turns out that Danny himself was a budding (to put it nicely) actor that was trying to become a truly famous headliner and playwright. As we went through the town we eventually found Danny in the theatre, consumed by a piece of the [[Seal of Infinity]], thorned stems seeming to bind Danny. 

We recovered this piece and it merged with our previous Seal piece. We let Danny skip town knowing that he learned some sort of lesson here.
