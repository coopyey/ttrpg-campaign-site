**Full Name:** Bobbi Walker

A changeling woman with heterochromia with red and yellow eyes that slowly shift between each other. She is very tall and very muscular, with short cut hair. Bobbi is a fixture in this city, with her family name going back generations here. They are a family with means and money, but she specifically wishes to give back to the community, so she runs a soup kitchen. She is the granddaughter of [[Grandfather Walker]].
