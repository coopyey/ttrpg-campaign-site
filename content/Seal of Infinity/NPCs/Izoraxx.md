Another Sage, like [[Axamonar]], but with exactly opposite energy. He is a bald man that looks like an upset vulture, and dressed in all black more due to a lack of trying than any attempt to be stylish. His entire schtick is that he is brutally efficient. There is a possibility that he is the head of the [[Ministry of Divination]], but this is not confirmed.

He spoke with [[Faylen]] during the trial against Axamonar. He threatens to eliminate Faylen, which Faylen (erroneously) interprets as a threat to kick him out of school so he could not return to his studies after this adventure was done.
