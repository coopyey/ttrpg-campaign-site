**Class:** Wizard

**Title:** Sage

Quite famous for his power and skill in magic, especially with a battlemage focus. He clearly knows his shit and acts as such: he is generally nonplussed with situations. After giving up his original form to stop the creature that destroyed the train transporting the [[Seal of Infinity]], he became a robot wizard with *some righteous abs*.

He was originally transporting the sliver of the Seal of Infinity to the Duchy of [[Brex Grana]], but he had to leave us to it while he took care of getting a physical form and reporting what had happened.

While we were in Brex Grana, we found out that he had been arrested in the Hollow World and held in the [[Verdant Core]] below to face trial. He had commented that this was most unusual as we should have been more aware of what was going on and what charges were being held against him as we were summoned.
