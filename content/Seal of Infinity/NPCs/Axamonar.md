**Class:** Wizard

**Title:** Sage

Quite famous for his power and skill in magic, especially with a battlemage focus. He clearly knows his shit and acts as such: he is generally nonplussed with situations. After giving up his original form to stop the creature that destroyed the train transporting the [[Seal of Infinity]], he became a robot wizard with *some righteous abs*.

He was originally transporting the sliver of the Seal of Infinity to the Duchy of [[Brex Grana]], but he had to leave us to it while he took care of getting a physical form and reporting what had happened.
