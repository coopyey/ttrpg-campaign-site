**Full Name:** Garm Clapperclaw

Leader of the [[Blue Fang]]. He was hoping to overtake [[Grandfather Walker]] and his granddaughter [[Bobbi]] to take over the [[Brex Grana Werewolves]] and control them. 

He went so far as he was ready to start an all out war between the two factions on the night of the full moon, a week after we arrived in the city. To prepare for this war, he was turning random people into werewolves to build up his "army", and he was also collecting explosives to be used to destroy parts of the city.

He claims that the Walker family is an old family that has quit innovating and they're leaving things as they are, which is broken. He would like to come in and start implementing new ideas, building aorder, and doing better than the Walker family in general. He personally has a nothing against hte changelings but there is a lot of new blood around here and they need to all fall in line.
