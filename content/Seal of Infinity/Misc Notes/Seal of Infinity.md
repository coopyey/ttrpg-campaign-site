Class: Notes
Campaign: Seal of Infinity
---
At the start, there were rumors that the Seal of Infinity had been stolen by someone. The Seal is a powerful magical artefact that is rumored to be the source of all magic.

We learn in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 004|Session 004]] that there was an attack on the chamber that the Seal was kept in in the city of [[Jewel]] and the Seal was shattered into pieces. The majority of the pieces were taken to the [[Dark Demesne]], while some of the smaller pieces remained scattered around here (which we have one such piece). We are taking the piece we have to [[Brex Grana]] as they have a magical vault where they can store the piece so the Dark Demesne can't find it.
