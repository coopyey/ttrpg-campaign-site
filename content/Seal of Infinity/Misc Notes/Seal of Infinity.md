Class: Notes
Campaign: Seal of Infinity
---
At the start, there were rumors that the Seal of Infinity had been stolen by someone. The Seal is a powerful magical artefact that is rumored to be the source of all magic.

We learn in [[content/Seal of Infinity/Session Notes/Session 004|Session 004]] that there was an attack on the chamber that the Seal was kept in in the city of [[Jewel]] and the Seal was shattered into pieces. The majority of the pieces were taken to the [[Dark Demesne]], while some of the smaller pieces remained scattered around here (which we have one such piece). We are taking the piece we have to [[Brex Grana]] as they have a magical vault where they can store the piece so the Dark Demesne can't find it.

>She can call upon her woodland friends to help her, and the Seal will protect them so they are not harmed in doing so. 

*Note: We have tweaked Call of the Wild from its original form, so if what is described in notes do not match the base version, this is why.*

Bosch: **[Shattered Earth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Relics.aspx?ID=150)**
>Summons a seismic energy and has complete control of it. When he tested, there was a ten foot patch of stone around him that became difficult terrain. 

Tabby: **[Whammy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Relics.aspx?ID=99)**
>Tabby can call upon the fae once a day and they will aid him by hindering the enemy. He essentially is able to impose misfortune (disadvantage) on an enemy after they roll a success on something.
