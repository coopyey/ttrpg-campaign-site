I was not present for this session, below is just a quick summary.

---

Bosch broke a window to let Faylen get out and Faylen disappeared into the city, so he wasnâ€™t kidnapped.

Bosch later explained this as he was going for backup. We passed ourselves off to the werewolves as representatives of the Misconduct Department (to Bobbi). Bobbi definitely eventually introduced herself to Bosch as Bobbi Walker.

---

Mary manages to talk her way through the club and trips on her way out of the club so that Tabby steps in and scares the werewolf grunts off.

---

If we see any of these guys alive again we can assume they have more specific orders about us.

---

People are being turned into wolves a lot and explosives are being collected, planning on an all out war. We have until the full moon to stop that, with the full moon about a week away. We found this out because the tree druid used some mice to spy on them to find out information.

Tree druid man is worried about both the trees and wants to protect the Changelings.
