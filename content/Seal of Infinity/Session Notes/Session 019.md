I was not present for this session, below is just a quick summary.

---

There was an attack on the soup kitchen so [[Bosch]] broke a window to let [[Faylen]] get out and Faylen disappeared into the city, so he wasnâ€™t kidnapped.

Bosch later explained this as he was going for backup. We passed ourselves off to the werewolves as representatives of the Misconduct Department ([[Ministry of Divination]]) (to Bobbi). Bobbi definitely eventually introduced herself to Bosch as Bobbi Walker.

---

[[Mary]] manages to talk her way through the club and trips on her way out of the club so that [[Tabby]] steps in and scares the werewolf grunts off.

---

If we see any of these guys alive again we can assume they have more specific orders about us.

---

People are being turned into wolves a lot and explosives are being collected, planning on an all out war. We have until the full moon to stop that, with the full moon about a week away. We found this out because the tree druid used some mice to spy on them to find out information.

[[Joe]] Bullheart is worried about both the trees and wants to protect the Changelings.
