The forest dragon who apparently rules/protects [[Verdant Core]] put the place into lockdown. Complete with some kind of plant-based shield. We wanted to leave, so we went to try to speak to this dragon. Unfortunately, no one knew where to find him. We called in a favor from the fey, and ended up having a meal with a Master of the Hunt. The idea was that if we made a good impression, he could take us to the dragon. At least three of us ate the food; [[Faylen]]'s decision was left ambiguous.

It was a freshly-hunted deer. [[Bosch]] told a lightly-edited story of what we'd been up to around here, and it went over well. They fey didn't seem to care about the details or omissions or who was technically to blame for what. It was just a fun story. Tabby was the one to make the request to see the dragon. Natural 20. Alan told us that he'd thought to himself as the die was rolling, "if [[Tabby]] rolls a nat 20 right now, we'll just skip the dragon."

So it turns out that this Master of the Hunt was so impressed by Tabby's skills in "hunting," he decided to try hunting in the surface world. And as long as he was going, he could bring us along.

At some point along the line, someone mentioned a party, and Bosch commented that he'd love to attend a fey party. The hunter nodded at this, and intoned in a voice that echoed in Bosch's head: "It is settled. Bosch Brak, you shall attend our next festivities." 

After this, Bosch had a sense that he would just know when and where to show up - and that he might not have a choice. I asked the group out of character who's worse off: a person foolish enough to attend a fey party, or a party foolish enough to invite Bosch? We'll just have to see...

So anyway, that was cool, and we magiced our way back to [[Brex Grana]], and the hunter guy headed off to the woods. Looking over at the city, we saw much of it in flames, with a big hole where the palace used to be.
