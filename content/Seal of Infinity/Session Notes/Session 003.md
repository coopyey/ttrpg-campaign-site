## Session Notes

The dragon hovers in the sky above us, gloating. Pippin realizes it is a wispling — a piece of an umbral dragon, but not the full thing. For it to be this big the original dragon must be huge, though. The hobgoblins explain the dragon has never been seen before.

Bosch says this is officially Fort Dragonslayer. The dragon laughs at this and says he likes this little man, which Bosch says he doesn’t like being called little.

Combat starts. We manage to take care of the wispling and Mary heals Pavlar up, who was brought to death’s door. He is stunned after all of this, trying to figure out why the draogn was sent here. He explains that another was killed: a descendent of Braavegut, but he was a coward (his name was Sedo).

Faylen recalls reading about something like this: sometimes when a curse is placed on an organization or land, blood can be used as a sacrifice. Whoever was trying to break this curse was trying to be clever and use the weakest of this bloodline to do so. We find out that there are a number of people here that are related to the curse:

- Arkig is descended from a famous hobgoblin strategist
- Kaydi is descended from Pradam the Patriarch
- Pavlar is the final descendent of the great king of the hobgoblins

Bosch points out that they are not necessarily beholden to stay here, and the people who signed the contract clearly did not expect this lot to live. The dragon will know the debt is not paid, but the hobgoblin command will not know and may need to find an alternative solution for this sacrifice.

Tabby runs to explain to the pixies that the hobgoblins were misguided and that we had to fight a dragon — specifically, an umbral dragon. There aren’t many umbral dragons but there is one nearby that is a real bad guy, to the point they won’t even speak his name.

The group and the remaining hobgoblins take time to make the fort looks like the dragon very thoroughly destroyed it and killed everyone there, then the hobgoblins leave to find their own way. They gift us a map with Jewel and Brex Grana on it.

On the train we were two weeks out from our destination, so we are quite some ways out here. The pixies give Tabby a boon: a vial of clean dew. When he drinks it, the boon appears.
