Last we left our intrepid heroes we were outside of a mansion in the ruins [[Brex Grana]] and the thing that was posing as a wizard that [[Clapperclaw]] called his "ace in the hole" was distracted by [[Faylen]] throwing a spell and it coming to deal with us. It grows in size and is a staticy creature as it moves toward us. The air around it glitches as it moves toward us, and there's four things around it as well.

Faylen tries to recall knowledge on these things and despite his studying, the creatures of the [[Dark Demesne]] are particularly tough. Faylen doesn't know anything about these things that could be worthwhile.

Glitches:
- AC: 17
- HP: <=7 lmfao
- Low will
- Can drain HP from characters as temp HP(?)

"Ace in the Hole":
- AC: 20?
- Forbidden Thought: block a character from taking an action (stride, attack ,etc)

During the fight, we noticed that it was specifically avoiding Faylen and trying not to harm him. He was carrying the [[Seal of Infinity]], which may possibly be part of what's going on.

One of the glitches attaches to and drains [[Mary]] a bit, seeming to solidify its existence and solidifying a bit. Faylen manages to slash it so that it bleeds and we can tell that it does not have bodily functions per se, but it has some innate desire to belong to this world and plane and so it is basically mimicking living creatures. 

[[Bosch]] kills the creature with a final slash of the branch he picked up and in the flickering moments before it disperses Bosch can see three eyes looking at him with a gaze of pure hatred, though the hatred is because he belongs in the universe and he exists, and this thing doesn't but wishes it could. The remnants of the creature explodes outwards, and also up as if it was being recalled somewhere. There are more points from the city that are "recalled," suggesting this was not the full creature that we thought. Faylen gives Mary his potion of minor healing and she wakes up after being knocked unconscious in battle.

It is quiet after everything is all said and done, but it feels like a weight has been lifted from the entire city. Faylen realizes what the gap in his knowledge is: this has to be connected to the [[Dark Demesne]]. He considers this as he picks up the fragment of the Seal of Infinity. 

Nobody that was at the castle exists anymore. People are starting to come out and they're scared and angry and all of that. 

We find [[Gurt]] and update him with what we were up to and what we fought and he is glad we made it and that he apparently won in the pool that we would live through everything. Bosch has a little surprise that he picked up along the way to help Gurt with rebuilding the bar and he hands over a small figurine that is well-carved and has some jewels embedded. 

There's still the question about succession: will the prince become duke, or will they switch over to a democracy? Gurt's unsure.

[[Joe]] Bullheart finds us, as does [[Bobbi]]. We explain that we took care of whatever it was that [[Clapperclaw]] summoned, which makes Bobbi pleased. There is a field hospital that Joe and Bobbi takes us to so that we can get patched up, and Joe explains that they're trying to stop a revolt from happening. Joe takes us to a place where we can rest and take some time to ourselves.

Bosch hangs out with Gurt for likely the last time before we leave. He helps move heavy things around and clear some debris. He shoots the breeze with Gurt.

Faylen puts on a cloak to hide his own changeling heritage and then takes to the streets to watch the political events unfold. Faylen finds out that prince will ascend to be the new Duke, and then there will be a council or something of the like of the civilians to help better represent the people.
