[[Opal]] joins us today. :>

The last thing that Opal recalls is stepping through the portal. He's asleep, and as he's waking up he realizes he was put to sleep by a spell. What ultimately wakes him up is the feeling of falling followed by being hit by very cold water that he falls in. His outfit is ruined. There is a half goblin woman next to him that's half unconscious as well, and there are two sharks in the water.

Combat begins.

[[Mary]] calls out to the elephant as he's leaving and asks for help, as at least one person in the water is our friend and an elephant may be a large help in this.

We manage to fish an unconscious Opal and [[Vogue]] out of the water.

[[Faylen]] recognizes that the brine sharks aren't actual animals, but they're some type of elementals. They were brought here by magic. Mary knows they are elementals called brine sharks from the plane of water. They sometimes slip into oceans in our plane. Their weakest saves are WILL and they are as smart as normal animals. They were brought here by magic and Mary figures that they might have been brought here by the beast tamer, and this seems to be primal magic. The spell can expire, so they can be sent away back to the plane of water.

Mary heard a voice yelling at the elephant to go back to the back area. The beast tamer never makes it out to here, but he definitely does grumble about it. She heals Opal and Vogue up and gets them back on their feet and Opal is very confused about everything going on and we explain that this isn't a clown dimension but we are in a circus at the moment.

Opal hears there was a poster and goes out - with Faylen following him - to see the poster. The poster does not have a picture of Opal, but just a listing of the attractions. Opal tears up a leaflet and tucks it into his bag as he talks about the time he did the clown makeup with his friend [[Yuna]].

Faylen looks over the townsfolk that are transfixed and he can tell that this is a bigger and more elaborate version of the scheme that [[The Vim & Vigor Brothers]] were doing. They were mesmerized by the show but with no show the magic is sort of slipping away. There's nobody outside of the tent, even the workers, and it occurs to Faylen that the employees are now robbing the town blind.

[[Bosch]] and Vogue sneak off and are stealing from the employees stealing from the townsfolk in the audience. He ultimately dumps out all of the items and picks one sparkly item up and takes it with him while leaving it out.

Vogue says the brothers are tied up in a tent nearby and there are some guards there with them. She explains they're the type of the guys they don't even allow to actually loot empty houses.

Theo and Elias are two of [[The Bone Boys]] - the ones that said one of them always tells the truth, and the other always lies. Mary tells them to go back to [[Brex Grana]]. They look us all over, then look at the elephant, and agree, and leave. Vogue stops and pulls her brothers up by their ears and is so glad to see them.

Opal mentions the clown dimension one (1) more time and Faylen asks where he's from if he's not from here, and Opal explains that normally he responds that he's from Hell, but apparently a different hell. He says he's from Golarion, and we admit we don't know where that is.  Bosch asks if there is a Golarioff, and Opal explains that Golarioff is basically the hollow world of Golarion that Opal is from. 

There is a lot of conversing and eventually Faylen recommends using the [[Seal of Infinity]] to send Opal back home. They find that the Seal has moved from Faylen's pack to [[Tabby]]'s and they don't think too much about it at this time, though Bosch absolutely did take it out of Faylen's pack and then move it to Tabby's at some point in everything going on. It freaks Faylen out quite a bit as he thought it had been lost, but Tabby manages to find it.

Tabby goes to hand the Seal to Opal because Opal wanted to look at it, and Faylen snatches it back and says it may not be a good idea to hand the Seal to random strangers that we save from evil clowns. Opal pouts a little about it, but Faylen cuts through it and asks if we should perhaps find [[Oddball the Clown]]  and finish this up. The group agrees and we set off, while Opal and Bosch try a two pronged approach to convince The Vim & Vigor Brothers to take the elephant with them, and then the elephant come with the group. We ultimately dash both Opal and Bosch's dreams about the elephant.
