After I left last session, the group goes to figure out what happened to Joe the druid. The creature had stomped him so we patched him up and explained that we took care of the werewolf. We explained that we needed a new place to stay because the tavern was no longer safe, so he took us down to the sewer. When we enter the proper sewer we are in a great stonework area. Joe explains he’s going to take us to see some friends, and by friends he means they haven’t argued in a few weeks and so we likely won’t be met by crossbow bolts.

Mary asks if Joe and Kevin could get the city rats to help us: she recalls everything is being held in a cellar, and the sewer could likely connect, so the rats could easily get into that cellar everywhere. Bosch, Tabby, and Killian could distract the guards at dawn, while Joe and Mary could get the help of the rats to get the items out of the cellar. Joe also offers that perhaps his friends that we are going to meet may also be able to help with removing these items from the cellar.

As we move through the sewers Faylen is almost hyper aware of what’s going on down here. He hears humanoid feet on the cobblestones and they are not wearing shoes. Joe and Faylen have a little tiny disagreement about how the sewer is gross, and another voice pipes up saying that he can get used to it as it’s not that bad. The group looks over and there’s a group of elves with hand crossbows lowered, no shoes, and they’re perhaps slightly amused at what’s before them.

A boy younger than Faylen asks what they can do to make us leave, and we explain that we’re hiding from the guards. They are also hiding from the guards — and everyone else — and they don’t want to be a larger group that the guards will be more likely to find. Mary recommends they show us an area they’re not in so that we don’t disturb them, and Tabby recommends they help us so we leave sooner. They like the idea of us staying to the fringes. We move on and we leave what we realize was the nicest part of the sewer, but we soon find an area that seemed to be made for the maintenance crew. We make camp and rest here, and gosh it’s been a real long day.

Joe asks Kevin for help, and Kevin is apparently more magical than we’d thought and a swarm of rats comes along bringing food for us to eat, and other items to make our rest more comfortable. The rats are clearly conversing among themselves. Mary heals Bosch and Faylen up and does a very beautiful job with it.

We start discussing what we need to do:

- Stop a werewolf gang war from starting
- Take care of the weapons and explosives cache
- Tree trial??

The plan is that we go to distract everyone, then flush everything down the sewer. We discuss what we can do and Faylen explains that he can disguise himself if that would be useful. Tabby suggests that Faylen disguises himself as a guard and then arrest the two to get them inside. Faylen likes the idea: it’s possible that this could get them inside without much trouble.

Note — we do have olfactory obfuscators that will hide our scents for ten minutes.

Faylen, Bosch, and Tabby leave and we see that there’s a mix of guards and police. The guards are the people who were with Ram and there aren’t that many. It seems that Ram has their own department that are utterly corrupt and they work for him and not Duke.

Bosch jumps through the window and into the building, with Tabby climbing up the side of the building. Bosch tells Tabby to observe: this is how you start a fight in a gang. He focuses and finds a few important items, moving them around into everyone else’s stuff so that they would all accuse each other of stealing their other things. Tabby can tell that Bosch is reliving something that he’s done in the past and has a sense of the vibe of each of the people who’s stuff he’s messing with, as if he recognizes bits of their personalities from his old gang. Tabby can be sure that he’s done this before to a different gang.

Tabby comments this isn’t the first time Bosch has done this, and Bosch says definitely not. Tabby approves, then asks how to get the guards up here to start fighting. Bosch says there’s a few ways to do that.

Faylen strides up to the front door and walks right on past the guards at the front. He heads upstairs to where the others are and Bosch explains that we need to create a commotion now, and Bosch finds a pair of guards that are here. They’re discussing how the Captain is just going to do something, how it will be a slap on the wrist for him, it’s just goblin barman (Gurt, he means Gurt).

Bosch overhears this and goes into rage instead, throwing his plan out the window. He throws the valuable item — a locket showing a werewolf’s partner — at one of the guards in his rage.
