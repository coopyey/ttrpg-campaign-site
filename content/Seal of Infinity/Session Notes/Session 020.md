We are back at the Murky Dragonfruit, the bar with Gurt, and Joe the tree druid is with us. We start talking about what to do and Bosch first recommends we blow up the bombs, and Mary is concerned about innocent people being collateral damage. Tabby then recommends that we disable the bombs, and that would certainly be nice. Joe does mention that we are trying to avoid the war and we do speculate if all the changes into werewolves are even consensual, and then we possibly consider seeing if Grandfather Walker will help the fresh werewolves.

Joe says the first few days of being infected as a werewolf is an incubation period where someone’s in pain and they growl, but after that he doesn’t actually know. Mary says that’s where we need help from experienced werewolves.

We talk about multiple possible plans and Bosch recommends we take care of the Clapperclaw’s warehouse with a faked fire in order to expose him and that feels like a really good idea, though we’re not quite sure on the logistics of that. It’s suggested that we have Grandfather Walker turn him over, but we’re not sure about that either. Mary does feel that we should warn Bobbi about the fact that she’s being specifically targeted by the wizard gentleman. Joe does speak up and says that the faction of werewolves behind Bobbi seem to be far more rational and seem to be going more legit. Joe agrees to go talk to Bobbi for us.

Bosch notices that a guard captain is in the bar. Bosch writes out a note with an anonymous tip that there will be a chance to catch a criminal at a certain time and place. He signs the note as “-MD”. This is a captain who is alone, and the guards typically move in pairs or more as they move about the city because of how much of a powder keg the city is.

Tabby and Faylen don’t know who the specific captain is but we both notice that he is specifically watching us. The captain is trying very hard to be subtle about this but it’s clear that the’s watching us. Tabby makes the comment that he’s clearly a pretty sturdy guy that packs a punch and Tabby feels that he could take him but changes the topic when Faylen asks if he couldn’t take him. Tabby changes the subject and asks where Bosch went and Faylen says Bosch probably went to get another drink or something, and Bosch does finish dropping the note off to go get some pickles from the bar, then he returns to his room to get a blanket and the plushie seal of infinity. He ties the seal up into the blanket with a piece of string as if it were in a sack.

We get moving and get to the warehouse, a brick and mortar building. It seems to be too small and Kevin explains that there are floors, including a basement. We don’t notice anything strange here: this warehouse is one of many, which seems to be part of the plan. All of the warehouses have guards, but the one we are concerned with doesn’t seem to have more than anyone else but there are some unusual dogs patrolling around and in the warehouse. Mary can tell that they are actually wolves and not dogs. Kevin goes to investigate the wolves and gets snapped at, a little hurt. He explains they are dire wolves, not werewolves.

Tabby explains that dire wolves are bigger, stronger, and faster than regular wolves. Mary assumes that magic is involved to control them.

Bosch has since wandered off and pretend to be making a delivery and makes a comment about how dangerous it is to be around those large aggressive-looking dogs, and asks if they have any time off together. He starts to make a pitch about unionizing against unfair working conditions, such as dangerous guard dogs. The boys are excited about being in a union and Bosch says the best way to stick it to their boss is to leave and go home and tell their bosses that it’s too dangerous. While everyone else leaves, the werewolf boys stay behind and continue working.

Tabby makes it to the top of the building and makes the path for us to get up much easier. We all make it up to the roof and there is a skylight up here. Bosch and Tabby find a piece of rope and slip in quietly as Taletha and Kevin split off to search elsewhere.

Tabby and Bosch find the office and start sifting through the office to search for what is important. Bosch doesn’t find anything that he can make sense of but he extrapolates things.

Tabby starts to walk through and he runs into the Misconduct Department lady and she says that she’s supposed to be here. She starts to make a commotion.

Faylen and Mary hear the commotion and Faylen quickly descends the building and starts faking as if he’s needing to pick up a package to distract and slow the guards down. They don’t quite buy it but he manages to slow them down a bit.

Bosch fashions a fake person and doesn’t do a great job, and props the door closed with a few books.

Tabby quickly asks if the guards thinks she’s supposed to be here and she smugly smiles and calls out for the guards, as she has a rat for him to deal with. The guards say yes ma’am and start to deal.

Mary can tell the guards don’t seem intent on hurting Tabby, so it’s definitely not a life or death situation. The lady also thinks we’re incompetent as she manages to get Tabby kicked out.

The captain puts an arm around Faylen and starts leading him towards the warehouse, saying that his lie wasn’t bad but Faylen should be less nervous in the future, and explains that he was put on their trail thanks to the government lady and that this is something that needs a gentle touch. He explains that Agent Bryce has explained everything to him and we will not pull anything over Guard Captain Idwal Ram.

Mary is still on the roof and Bosch is still inside. He gets dragged out by the guards and pretends to be struggling against them. Once he’s out of sight from Agent Bryce, Tabby attempts to free him from the guards, and it absolutely works. They manage to get away from the guards and Bosch lays down a fake version of Axamonar’s sigil to make it look like they were saved by him. Mary and Faylen leave.
