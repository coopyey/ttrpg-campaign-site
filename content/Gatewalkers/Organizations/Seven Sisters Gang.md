Your typical criminal organization that exists in a city.
## Other Notes
Are active in [[Sevenarches]]. They have a space outside of the western side of town that acts as their headquarters.

This is a literal gang of seven sisters. They have operated for so long that there is a possibility they have connections with the [[Oakstewards]]. To have no ties to [[Bolan]] at all - they would prefer he be stopped, as he could overthrow the kingdom and that would be bad for their business.
