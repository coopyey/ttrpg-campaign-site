## Other Notes

Wiki article [here](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Oakstewards).

The Oakstewards are a druidic order that rules over the River Kingdom of [[Sevenarches]]. While they can be detached, they are strong rulers that operate in secret. Nobody knows just how many they are, and they are unmoved by cries of human injustice. They care more about protecting the land and their people.

They meet in secret at a lodge in the Elderwoods. The lodge resembles a great hall made by the branches of huge, ancient oak trees.
