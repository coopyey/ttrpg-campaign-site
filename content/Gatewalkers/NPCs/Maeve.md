**Full Name:** Maeve "Ma" Moseby

A farmer in the [[Thinlands Farms]] that was attacked.

She was glad that we arrived and were seriously investigating what was going on. She was also admittedly glad that we were here to listen to her husband's ([[Pabel]]) raving about the attack and the loss of their mule.
