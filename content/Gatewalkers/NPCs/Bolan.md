Previously a guard in [[Sevenarches]] that watched over the real arches. He had the guards with him at the time stepped through the arch and then eventually returned. He stole a magic item of some sort and now hides in the Wildwoods with other malcontents, recruiting more disgruntled druids to his cause over time. We wanted to find him to figure out what it was he saw and what it is he knew about the portals.

He was hiding out in the [[Wildwood]] in an old gnomish house in the forest.
