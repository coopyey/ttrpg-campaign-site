A corrupt druid and follower of [[Bolan]] that we ran into in the [[Wildwood]]. She was working with two other druids to sacrifice a unicorn in their work to bring back the [[Obnubilate Curse]] in the area. She explained that all "civilized" people should die. She gave us the location of where Bolan was holed up.
