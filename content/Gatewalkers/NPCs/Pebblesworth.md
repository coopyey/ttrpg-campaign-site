**Full Name:** Hatria Pebblesworth

The other victim of the gorga attack in the [[Thinlands Farms]]: she died in the attack. Her body was found, but there were no obvious wounds. Of note: her body **didn't cast any shadows at all**, which is definitely strange.

We later learned that this was because of how temagyr can attack, wound, and kill their targets.
