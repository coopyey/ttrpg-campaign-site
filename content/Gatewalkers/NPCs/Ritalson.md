**Full Name:** Etward Ritalson

A fellow gatewalker and peculiar Ustalavic researcher. He is determined to understand exactly what happened during [[The Missing Moment]] and understanding the new powers that some have apparently received after the event. He put together our group to conduct field research in his stead.

A somewhat older man with some veins engorged. He has purple eyes that are burning with energy. He is a very private man. He generally gives off vibes adjacent to Charles Xavier.
