**Full Name:** Pabel "Pa" Moseby

A farmer in the [[Thinlands Farms]] that was attacked. 

He had been hurt pretty seriously from the attack and so was bandaged and bed-bound. When we saw him his eyes were wild and he raved about the attack, ranting about creatures called temagyr and a thin not-quite-humanoid shadowy figure with a weird smile behind them. He ultimately breaks down crying about the loss of his mule.
