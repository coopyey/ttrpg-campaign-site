An elf friend of Dr. [[Ritalson]]. She met us outside of [[Sevenarches]] to brief us before letting us go in, since she couldn't enter due to being an elf and she has no desire to test to see if the [[Obnubilate Curse]] was actually gone from the area.

She believed that the seven arches in the center of the city were actually decoys to draw attention away from the real portals. She gave us an aura reader that was tuned for the portals and needed us to get readings on the portals in the center of the city.
