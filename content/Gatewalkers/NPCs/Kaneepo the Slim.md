A fey creature that wanted to bring back the [[Obnubilate Curse]] to [[Sevenarches]] and the surrounding area. He was residing in [[The Thinlands]] and was the cause of people disappearing in the same area on Galorian. It was said that if we repeated his name enough he would become aware of or attack us.

He had the Shadewither Key that we were after on him, which [[Killian]] now carries.

We fought and found a few things out about him:
- Worst Save: Fort
- AC: 20
- Immunities:
	- Fear
