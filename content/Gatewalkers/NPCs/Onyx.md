>We were on [[Castrovel]] in [[Loskialua]] in [[Alleli]]'s home and the wall of her home exploded into the fabric of the universe tearing open. We saw a figure in an old timey diving suit explain that he was coming for his brother. The diving suit had infernal runes on it and after Ria slashed at the hands, the portal closed and nothing more happened.
