A d'ziriak that was hired by [[Kaneepo the Slim]] to chronicle his history. Her portraits require weaving quite a bit of magic, and [[Nighthold]] allows a level of magical malleability she cannot manage back at home so she doesn't mind working for Kaneepo and doing this for him.

Personally, she does not believe in Kaneepo and his belief, she's just an artist with a job. She's mostly building her portfolio, being paid in experience and exposure. :^)
