An elf living in [[Loskialua]] on [[Castrovel]]. 

She knew Golarion common and was very excited when we arrived in town. She is a scholar, and also dabbles in being a cleric of Desna (goddess of dreams, among other things). She has been in contact with a young stargazer named [[Sakuichi]] in [[Skywatch]] on Golarion.
