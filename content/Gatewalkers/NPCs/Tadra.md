A woman that was a guard in [[Loskialua]] on [[Castrovel]]. She had been a regular guard, but upon our arrival she became a shifter, shifting into a coerul woman with dark fur (much as Ria is a white lion woman). Ria helped talk her through this transformation and helped her come to terms with this new form.
