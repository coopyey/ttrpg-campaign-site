These are a group of creatures that act as prophet and historian. They gather in small cabals and use their brain power to unravel mysteries, and are telepathic. They have the ability to take memories from people.

They are much older than the elves and have been taking care of things such as the [[Memory Grove]] for a very, very long time. The city [[Loskialua]] exists *because* of the Memory Grove that they tend.
