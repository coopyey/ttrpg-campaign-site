        - You look nothing more than an ordinary toy, doll, or statuette, and you can fool others with this appearance. You are trained in Deception, and you can Impersonate an inanimate toy or a mindless poppet. You can hide without any cover or concealment from from creatures that don’t realize you’re alive, as long as you’re in a location where it makes sense.

**Age**: Unknown

**Background**: Root Worker

Some ailments can’t be cured by herbs alone. You learned ritual remedies as well, calling on nature spirits to soothe aches and ward off the evil eye. Taking up with adventurers has given you company on the road, as well as protection from those who would brand you a fake—or worse.

**Size Classification:** Small

**Thread Color:** Black

**Cloth Material**: Undyed cotton

Due to his warlock pact, he has a devouring maw in his back, along the threading that stitches him together. This maw is invisible while it is closed, but while open it is dark with very sharp teeth made of solid shadow and a a tongue that seems to flicker between black, grey, and dark purple — shifting as if it can’t decide what color to settle upon. The tongue is prehensile and able to take objects from Killian, or hand him objects from his holding.

## Personality

Generally is friendly, he’s more interested in knowledge and finding out who he was rather than saving the world. As long as you don’t comment on him for being a doll, or otherwise treat him like less than a person, he’s happy to hang out and call you a friend. Treating him as lesser is the only grudge he will really hold. More than happy to employ less than good means to accomplish a goal.

### Strengths

- Has no qualms doing what needs to be done

### Weaknesses

- Has a hard time forgiving people who actually upset him

## History

Killian does not recall much of his history as he is a poppet: whatever he was up to before he was a poppet was lost to him. He woke up one day as a poppet, with what he had on him at that time around him. Killian sifted through what notes were there and saw the name Killian written there and assumed it was the name he had previously.

He joined the initiative with the Gatewalkers as an excuse to adventure and get out there to try to find out who he was.

### Previous Life Notes (Killian Doesn’t Know)

**Ancestry**: Human

**Heritage**: Dhampir

Not much is really figured out for him, but he was a very unpleasant and mean man. He had evil goals and would do anything to achieve them, including something such as selling his soul to a patron to attain what he needs.
