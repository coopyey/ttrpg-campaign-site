**Background:** 
# Additional Notes
Opalescent skinned tiefling with poofy hair and subtle fire accenting. He has pointy ears and small horns. Dresses very flamboyantly and is very prissy and fussy, clearly a noble of some sort from the way he acts like he generally owns the place. He cars far too much about his appearance.

Father is a big mean dragon in the Hells, with his castle halfway between Hell and the Material Plane.
