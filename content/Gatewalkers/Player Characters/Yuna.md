# Additional Notes
Yuna is very upbeat, happy, and chipper. She's glad to be around us and have friends, wanting to help.

She comes from a cult that is very negative on Castrovel, and that is also known on Golarion. She left some 80 years ago, and doesn't seem to understand why the scars from the cult on her chin are so shocking to see.
