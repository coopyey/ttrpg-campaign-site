A strange place on [[Castrovel]] that [[Loskialua]] is built near.

This is a place where the dead can sort of live beyond their own mortal lifetime. It preserves the memories and knowledge of people so that it can be accessed at a later time, though this is not done for everyone.

It is tended by [[The Caulborn]].
