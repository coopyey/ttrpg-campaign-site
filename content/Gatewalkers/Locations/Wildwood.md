The woods south of [[Sevenarches]]. This is where the real arches are located, making it sacred to the [[Oakstewards]].

Strange things have been happening in the Wildwood. There were temagyr (fey creatures that are the embodiment of the fear of being hunted in the dark) and we ran into a strange area that had occult and fey magic opening and closing little portals. We find an altar with corrupt druids trying to sacrifice a unicorn in the heart of it as well, followers of [[Bolan]].
