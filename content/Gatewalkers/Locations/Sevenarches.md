Class: Location
Campaign: Gatewalkers
Type: Capital
Organization: "[[Oakstewards]]"
---
A heavily forested realm in the River Kingdoms of northeastern [[Avistan]].

Sevenarches is the capital of the River Kingdoms. The ruler of this region are the [[Oakstewards]]. The city itself guards a rift into the [[First World]] of the fey, so the Oakstewards are very picky about who they allow in. **Elves** are outright banned from the city, as are most outsiders.

There is a ban on elves in the city. Elves previously lived in the forest in the area, with the name of the city coming from the arches that the elves themselves built. I tis the Oaksteward elves that keep the elves out, which they do because of the [[Obnubilate Curse]]. This curse supposedly dissipated after [[The Missing Moment]]. We are also aware that there are many magical creatures in the area, but attacks from a specific type called gorgas are becoming more prevalent.
