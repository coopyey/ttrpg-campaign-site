Organization: "[[Oakstewards]]"
---
A heavily forested realm in the River Kingdoms of northeastern [[Avistan]].

Sevenarches is the capital of the River Kingdoms. The ruler of this region are the [[Oakstewards]]. The city itself guards a rift into the [[First World]] of the fey, so the Oakstewards are very picky about who they allow in. **Elves** are outright banned from the city, as are most outsiders.

So named for the portals that have the form of arches in the middle of the city. They are 10' tall and 20' wide, with a circle of oak trees around the arches that themselves act as a barrier around them.

There is a ban on elves in the city to protect them from the cursee. Elves previously lived in the forest in the area, with the name of the city coming from the arches that the elves themselves built. I tis the Oaksteward elves that keep the elves out, which they do because of the [[Obnubilate Curse]]. This curse supposedly dissipated after [[The Missing Moment]]. We are also aware that there are many magical creatures in the area, but attacks from a specific type called gorgas are becoming more prevalent.

We learned that the arches in the center of the city are actually fake. The real arches are to the south in the Wildwood.
