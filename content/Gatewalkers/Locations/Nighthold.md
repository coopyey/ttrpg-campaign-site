A region of the [[First World]] that once belonged to [[Count Ranalc]] before his disappearance. It has fallen to pieces since his exile.

The entire realm is shrouded in shadow and darkness. It is a very dangerous realm to be in but it is also incredibly easy to access as portals between the universe and the netherworld are relatively common.
