A tower on [[Castrovel]] near [[Loskialua]] that is used to contact and summon [[She Who Walks Through Seasons]].

The spire is about 60' tall and has windows and terraces at every floor. The uppermost ledge has a giant horn to signal. We had to clear out numerous dangerous creatures in order to reach the top.
