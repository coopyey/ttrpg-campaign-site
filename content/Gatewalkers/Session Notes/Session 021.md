We get past the horrible memory trap and we come across a room filled with bones and there are three skeletons that animate and attack us. We begin combat. We manage to take care of the undead and then we take a breather and patch each other up. During the breather, Yuna teaches Killian how to play patticake — he didn’t know how to play, so she took the time to teach him. We all loot the skeletons and learn how to play.

Opal notices that there’s a slim passage to the left or a wide open passage to the right. We talk and go through the crack in the wall on the left. We move forward and there’s fungi and mushrooms choking the room to the right, and a glowing shield-shaped light on the western wall. Ria investigates the shield-shaped light and she can see that it is a buckler that has been enchanted in some way. Ria tries to take it and two of the mushrooms turn into leshy’s and move up to us, asking us to please stop.

The Leshy explains he needs it to live sometimes, but he’d be willing to trade. Mostly it’s just rude to come and take a mushroom’s shield. We explain that we didn’t know they needed it. We discuss and basically one of the Leshy just likes having a magic item. We manage to make a deal with them to give them a lot of the loot from the previous room and a fiddle, and Valentine gets the [[Glamorous Buckler]].

We eventually move on to the next room and we find some weird little snake-like creatures that introduces themselves as Jarvis and his friend. They need some information to set up an appointment with the Gardeners, who we recall are the keepers of this place. They start asking questions:

1. World of Origin
2. Species of Origin
3. Blood Type
4. First Memory
5. Second Memory
6. ….

And et cetera. Everyone but Killian realizes they’re not actually secretaries, they’re just living here asking questions. They explain that the Gardeners are behind the door, and they want to try to figure out our life’s story and the like. Everyone but Killian is asking questions and they ask if we don’t trust them, and everyone but Killian says we don’t trust them at all. They start asking for paper and spell books, and Killian hands them a piece of regular paper and then Valentine pulls out the book the Leshy was writing out and offers it to them, pretending it is a spell book.
