It takes half a day to march to the east to the spire. It is 60’ tall with windows and terraces at every floor. At the uppermost ledge is the giant horn to signal. They urge us forward as we stand outside and tells us that it is our part.

On the bottom floor in the entryway is an animal’s nest, emitting a pungent odor. There are stairs behind the way that lead to a catwalk that appears to be the way we need go to continue on. Opal can see a strange insect-like animal that seems to be a cross between an insect and a dinosaur.

Opal steps forward and spreads his arms out and tells us to watch out. We ask watch out for what and Opal asks if we can see it, and we all confirm that we cannot. Opal starts yelling and the creature begins to attack.

AC: 24

We manage to take care of the creature and patch each other up.
