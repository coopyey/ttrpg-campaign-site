We take some time to settle in and get comfortable in [[Alleli]]’s basement and she eventually comes down as [[Yuna]] is washing off the clown makeup and she finally sees the ritual scarring on Yuna and we have a few tense moments while we convince her that Yuna is actually harmless. Alleli offers to heal the scars so they no longer exist, but Yuna wants to keep them and doesn’t see an issue with them. Alleli warns that people will attack us and the like and we all discuss the issues and danger of this and Yuna doesn’t seem to understand the issue.

Alleli ultimately says she’ll talk to the elders and get things figured out so that we won’t be attacked by any authority figures. She can’t do much for the actual people of the town. Yuna is basically stuck here until that gets sorted out so we essentially have a slumber party.
