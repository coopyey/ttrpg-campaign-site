We begin with Kaneepo combat. It’s a tough battle, but Ria finally bites into and tears Kaneepo apart and he dies, the temagyr dissolves into shadow, dead. We take some time to heal everyone up, and Killian goes to pick up the key we are searching for while Opal sends Zircon over to free Hubert.

Hubert’s been here for months, fed only when Kaneepo remembered to do so. Hiera also marches on up to the throne and destroys it by using their axe. Opal helps Hiera with this.

Hubert speaks up and asks how we are feeling: Hubert explains that the portal we used to get here and only Kaneepo can make those. Hubert isn’t sure how to get us back home. He explains that the Thinlands are safe but outside of the Thinlands are shadow storms that can strip us of our essence. The Shadewither key starts to tug gently in a direction as it glows, and Killian follows the tugging of the key down a secret door and cracked hallway. The pathway is unstable and cracked, starting to fall apart.

A tree branch starts to fall and stops and Count Ranalc. He says: You’re doing well, and Killian says only because of the power given to him. The Count says that his helpers are likely the ones that will talk to him more, especially as he has more warlocks. He says as he leaves the shadow plane it will likely be harder for the Count to contact him anyway, but his power will carry through. The Count tells him to go ahead, and Killian steps through the portal as the chamber collapses.

We come through in a humid air that shivers with chittering insects and beasts, with huge trees and a heavy canopy above. We stand on a stone plinth with a ruined building before us, with the building carved with strange runes and vines curled around it.

We are reasonably sure we’ve arrived in a tropical jungle. Hiera looks at the ground and sees something wrong with the place: something doesn’t fit correctly. It’s too hot and they have glimpse of understanding when they are in the galaxy, and we are not longer in Golarion. We are on another planet.
