[[Valentine]] von Daude (full name attained)

We wake in the morning to find a note from Valen outlining that there was an issue and he had to go back to the Doctor to deal with it. The note explains that a replacement has been found for him - Hiera is here. We have seen Hiera before, associated with the Doc. They are around but are clearly keeping vaguely to the side and not trying to start us.

Hiera deliberately shakes some branches and explains that it’s all right, that they have cleared the area. They ask how we all are and we have a chaotic back and forth where we aren’t really talking about anything productive at all. Open finally decides to join the land of the living and realizes that Hiera exists and starts to get up and put his heels on. He’s still tired and not at all happy that he had to get up and he’s trying very hard to get away from Valentine. Ria seems a little shy, meeting Hiera properly for the first time.

Killian starts to get his things together and set Vik up with his saddle for the day as Valentine and Opal argue. Ria catches Hiera up as to what they’ve been doing and where we are all going now - that we’re looking for this character we shouldn’t name and that we have another place to investigate for traces. Opal is changing from his sleeping outfit into his normal clothes: frilly and very flamboyant. Valentine takes Hiera’s hand and kisses it, to which Hiera decides to take it as being very formal. Opal gives Valentine a little bit of shit for it and they begin to quibble a bit, and Ria apologizes for how much they quibble, but reassures that they work well together when things get serious.

We all pack up and start to travel on: Ria at the front, Valentine with Killian on the belt, Opal, and then Hiera taking up the back. Vik decides to hang out with Hiera this time around.

Hiera definitely went to the city of Seven Arches to get information on the rest of the party and they got enough information to find them. We explain we’re headed to the Thinland Farms to continue our investigations as there is talk of Kaneepo. We explain what we found in our investigation so far into Kaneepo. The Thinlands is at the edge of the Wildwood, a magical forest that is very special to the druids that live here.

After a few hours of travel and chat we finally make it to the Thinlands region. The ride over was uneventful and pretty nice. The Thinlands is a mist-shrouded moor area. Hiera knows that all mist is somewhat magical in a way. There isn’t particularly dangerous about the mists as we approach. There are farms that are quite close together in this area and we will mostly be talking to local residents to actually do our investigation. We all begin to look around and ask around.

Information granted:

- Hiera and Killian see shadows of an invisible forest on the moors. There is a thin growth here, they quiver and boil. Killian recognizes those movements to be very similar to how the gorghasts and their shadows move.
- According to farmers that Opal has talked to - they aren’t just worried abut the gorgasts, the entire region has a long history of mysterious disappearances. The locals give him the name Kaneepo and Alderwoman Abelina Choi mentions that the locals are worried about Kaneepo.
- Valentine almost manages to get information out of the children, but they are more interested in how shiny Opal is lmfao
- The children tell Opal that they’ve seen a tall, shadowy figure that matches Kaneepo’s description. Nobody’s reported it because everyone knows saying Kaneepo’s name will draw his attention. The person who actually volunteers the name initially gets kinda smacked for it.
- Ria, Hiera, and Killian also figure out that the soil is incredibly fertile. Being here next to the fey and shadowy forest is worth the risk.
- The people talk about holes in the world that show through into the shadowy forest. Some brave folks went into them and none of them have ever returned. We assume that these are actually portals.

We sit down with all our information and realize a timing and pattern to all the sightings: according to the pattern, a phase portal will open in the middle of the night in the middle of a particular farm’s potato patch. Alderman Choi gives us access to her barn to rest in while we stay and investigate.
