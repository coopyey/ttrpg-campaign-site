[[Bolan]] surrendered previously. As a reminder, we are here to get the gate key. The Sunflower leshy was almost cut in half.

---

Bolan tells us to stop and tries to establish some dominance but [[Ria]] punches him in response. Zircon — [[Opal]]'s summon — then sits on top of Bolan and then [[Valen]] ties his hands up. We ask where the gate key is and Bolan says he already gave it to [[Kaneepo the Slim]]. Valen finds a +1 staff on Bolan, which he gives to Opal.

[[Valentine]] looks around the room while Opal tries to convince Bolan to use soap. We agree this isn't worth pursuing and Valen asks why Bolan was going to kill a unicorn, and the response is to bring back the curse as people are more or less out of balance with nature. Valen is pissed because unicorns are part of nature and punches him. Bolan also says that you do not search for Kaneepo, he comes to you. The guy is basically an 8' tall Nosferatu motherfucker that is in a forest that doesn't quite exist on the edge of the region we are in.

We take Bolan back to the [[Oakstewards]] and we explain the key was already lost. She pays us 30gp for stopping Bolan, and explains she'll give us more if we get the key.

She recommends the library to read up on it, and then the [[Thinlands Farms]] to check on the shadows of the forest that don't exist. [[Killian]] would like to check the library for information first before we leave for the Thinland Farms.

Valentine sells the leather armor to the Oakwardens and tries to sell the weed, but fails. Killian takes the weed and sells it, then takes one pack of the shiver and sells it to the Seven Sisters Gang. Killian will sell the second pack of shiver and suggests we trade it for poison as well.

The [[Quaking Stacks]] are the tallest structure in the city that was a tower taken over by aspen trees, shaped to protect the scrolls and books inside. We are given access by the librarians. The librarian helping us has a seeing-eye owl. We explain that we are looking for Kaneepo the Slim and we are instructed how to check the database for information:

- Defeat & Imprisonment of Slender Creature of Shadow
    - "The Slim" have been around for millennia
- Pathfinder Chronicles
    - Colorless forest in the [[Nighthold]] held by [[Count Ranalc]]
- Shadewither key can conjure a shadow copy of self to guard wearer from attacks

We decide we must act fast and [[Lemma]] finds us. There is something about the fae: there is a possibility that if you repeat his name it means they may be aware of or attack us. We have 72 hours before Kaneepo locates us, and we need to find them first.

Lemma also mentions [[Pabel]] Moseby that was ambushed two nights ago when returning home after selling turnips in Sevenarches. He is about a day away. Another attack on [[Pebblesworth]] also happened. Moseby is a day out from [[Sevenarches]], on the way to [[the Thinlands]]. We set up camp and Killian casts alarm around the camp site.

Ria and Valen notice a tall slender figure watching us from the shadows. Ria throws a javelin at it and the figure disappears without a trace. We then bed down for the night. When Ria tretrieves the javelin, there is a strange sigil: something between a five pointed star and a stick person.

I copy the sigil down and try to identify it.
