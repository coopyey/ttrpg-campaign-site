We take a short rest and cook up the monster we just killed. Valentine manages to knock it out of the park and we eat and rest. We pack up the rest of the cooked meat and put it in Killian’s void mouth and continue moving on. We head up the stairs to the catwalks that lead to the top of the tower, and there are two monsters that are waiting for us that Ria just about walks directly into.

There are two assassin vines (we don’t know what they are) and we fight them.

AC: 19ish
REF weakest save.
Weak to: Slashing, Fire

We take care of both of the assassin vines. We try to cook the assassin vines as a sort of vegan spaghetti, which we do.

Ria does such a great job of cooking them up and we all feel very refreshed after taking some to rest and eat.
