We make it to the Thinlands. It is mostly farmlands out here, so people are pretty spread out from each other. We get to the first house and a human woman in her 40s greets us and asks what we are doing, or if we need help. We learn that [[Kaneepo the Slim]] is sending out gorgasts and there are gorgasts attacking this area, with the targets being:

- Pabel "Pa" Moseby
- Maeve "Ma" Moseby

Inside the house a man speaks and he explains he's grieving over a mule. Ria explains that we are looking for Mr. Moseby and Maeve is glad someone will listen to him instead of her. We offer to listen to Maev and she tells us to talk to Pabel.

Pabel is bandaged and laying in the center of the bed with wild eyes. Valentine explains that we are here to investigate the attack. Pabel starts raving about the event and Valentine sits down and sets a notebook and pen down on the table with Valen to take notes. From his raving, we learn:

- The creatures are these weird skull dogs with black void eyes
    - Called temagyr
- He thinks he saw a full, thin, not quite humanoid shadowy figure with a weird smile behind them. He felt it was in his mind, and it left him feeling unworthy.
- Hatria Pebblesworth is the other victim, who was found dead. Her body was found but nobody could find obvious sounds, and her body didn't cast any shadows at all, which was fucking weird.
- Pabel was attacked on the road. Attacks around Seven Arches are normal at this time.

Kaneepo might be looking for something or testing something. Valen asks how he got away and the gorgasts focused on the mule, and Pabel just breaks down crying at this point. He started a memorial for the mule.

Left to investigate:

- Hatria's death
- Thinlands Farm

Valentine has an internal crisis about how he won't hurt Opal.

While Valen leads we move faster than expected to investigate Hatria's death. It is still light when we reach the site of her body. south of Seven Arches, and it is clear that people have been avoiding this area. The destroyed cart is still here as are all of Hatria's remains and the partially eaten remains of her mule.

We look around and find:

- Both flesh wounds & the shadow on the mule show gorgast attack
- Non-human footprints are back near the trees
- Both sets of prints randomly disappear and then reappear further off
- Footprints appear from a strangely verdant forest clearing with flowers that are blooming out of season
    - The colors here are weirdly drab: the magical residue is consistent of a portal from the First World
    - The portal was open for maybe an hourish

We head out and set up camp in a clearing. Five temagyrs show up and attack. We manage to kill them all. Ria finds that there is the same runic symbol on these creatures' throat â€” they are clearly sent by Kaneepo the Slim. We heal up via potion and Valen and pack up camp to get ready for the day.
