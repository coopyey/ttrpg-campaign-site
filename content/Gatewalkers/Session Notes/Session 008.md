In the portal, the moors are dark and gloomy, bleached of color and foggy. There is a footpath that leads into the forest. Ria sticks her hand into the portal and it’s cold but she is not harmed. The wind is blowing continuously and the air drains everything in this plane of color.

This area is called Nighthold - a shadowy version of the first world. It fell to pieces when its master, [[Count Ranalc]] was exiled. This place is very dangerous but is incredibly easy to access through portals that tear through the material and the shadow plane.

Note for the Pathfinder Remaster:

- Material Plane will become “The Universe”
- Shadow Plane will become “Netherworld”

[[Kaneepo the Slim]]’s lair is a giant tree that looms over the other foliage. There are thorns on all the trees in this area so we approach very carefully. There is a creature outside of Kaneepo’s lair - a gorgast, but something other than the temagyr we’ve faced before. Ria knows this is an oclueye - the fear of being lost in the darkness. It resembles a feathered owl with monkey legs and oversized eye sockets filled with shadows. A field of unnatural darkness surrounds it. Ria approaches it and the thing shows her nightmarish images and she roars at it. The thing laughs in response and combat starts.

We manage to kill the thing after a few tense moments, with [[Hiera]] going down for a moment and Killian having to bring them back up. We help them up and open the door into the Tooth Tunnel: a pillar of living wood to the side have been carved into a humanoid figure to the side of the chamber. To the east is a door that delves deeper into the stump. There is a tooth fairy swarm in here, gathering in the chamber.
