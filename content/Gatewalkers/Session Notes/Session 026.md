Apologies on the sparse notes, it was a day where it was hard for me to focus on anything. This session was mostly downtime because most of us had a hard week. It was a lot of just hanging out.

We have some down time after we take care of getting rid of the curse.

[[Valentine]] and [[Opal]] - and also [[Yuna]] by association - are all basking in the fame that has come with the fact that we saved a scientist and met a demi-god.

In the evening, [[Ria]] and [[Tadra]] cook up the meat that they managed to hunt from the forest. Valentine flirts with Opal and makes Opal blush.
