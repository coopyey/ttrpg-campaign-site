We’re on the gondola headed toward civilization. Opal’s trying to fix their hair. Ria and Valentine are keeping eyes open for danger while Hiera works on navigation to try to make sure we are headed where we want.

As I look at the gondola I start to wonder what would happen if I pushed Opal over the edge and there’s a safety feature if we are to fall off the platform. There’s some mechanism to bring us back to the platform. It wouldn’t be pleasant, but it does exist. We all start to argue with each other and have conversation, until some pteranodons see us and swoop in for an attack.

Lowest save: Will

I recall that pteranodons are animals. They don’t have any specific features. They prioritize swooping to pick us up. We probably don’t have to kill this guy as much as boop him so he gets scared and goes away. We manage to kill it because it tries to swoop at Opal and misses, and we take care of things.

The rest of the gondola ride is uneventful and we make it to the city as the sun is setting. There are worksites around the city with cranes working on them, light glints off of telescopes of the city with one large one in the center of the city. A group of elves are waiting for us at the platform. Yuna isn’t wanting to actually cover her cult markings up, and we are concerned about the reception, and Opal lies to Yuna and explains that we wear clown makeup to bond with each other upon joining the group. This works and Yuna allows Opal to apply clown makeup.

The elves waiting for us do not seem threatening: they’re wearing robes and leathers like adventurers. They have beautiful jewelry that’s star themed, silver and gold bangles with gems.

They are clearly scholars and speak in multiple languages, all of them ultimately asking who we are, where we’re from, and why we’re here. A woman gets excited and comes over speaking in Golarion common. She’s very excited and pulls Opal to one of many telescopes. Valentine boosts Killian to look through the telescope. There’s a bright star low in the darkening sky: a pale blue dot, Golarion. The woman’s name is Alleli.

We are on the continent of Ukulam and are currently with a group of people called the Oatia, who are scholars that study the sky and stars. We realize that elves here are pretty similar culturally to elves on Golarion, though the elves here are focused on Desna worship. Desna is the goddess of dreams, among other things.

Alleli is very excited about us being here. She invites us to her house and she gives us the basement. Her house is a bit messy — she clearly works hard and too much without spending too much time at home. There is a room with a telescope, which is spotless. She clearly eats takeout whenever she can and she speaks Golarion common, and mentioned sending a message to a friend of hers as she explains that it’ll be so interesting and her friend will be interested.

Opal asks what she wants to know and she explains she is a scholar and that she is a bit of a cleric for Desna. She makes the sign of Desna and Valentine makes it as well, which surprises her a bit. He explains that Golarion has Desna worshiping elves.

Ria asks how she knew we’re from Golarion, and she explains we aren’t the first she’s been in contact with, just the first she’s actually seen. She was working in the main observatory and she received a message from a city called Skywatch and a young stargazer called Sakuichi stumbled on a magical telescope which sent a message to here. The connection was unfortunately lost, but she wants to study the transmission and reverse engineer it, and maybe she can send us back home that way. She says that we are welcome to stay and tells us to rest, and on the morrow she will rope her friend in to talk to us and answer questions.
