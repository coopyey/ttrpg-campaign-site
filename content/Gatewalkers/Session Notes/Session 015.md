We enter a quarry and there is a tower in the center of the room with curved runic pillars creating the path with which the gondola is carried. We see some constructs that seem to be protecting the place. They’re a dark mineral here that sparkles like stars and is important to astral-loving elves that live in the city connected to the light lines. The gondola arrives at the quarry every 20 minutes — they’re wooden platforms connected to the light lines via enchanted cables. It arrives, waits to be loaded, then heads back to the city.

I can tell that the constructs are not particularly smart. They will identify us as enemies because we are not of the people in the city, but if they can’t see us they can’t identify us. We discuss what we want to do as a plan and we seem to settle on sneaking through the area to bypass the constructs. Killian fails to sneak past and gets killed but one of the constructs, and the rest of the group destroys the constructs and heals Killian so he gets back up. Opal finds some celernium (the starry mineral) to take with him that will provide bonuses for him crystal healing.

We all get on the gondola to get to the city.
