[[Alleli]] is with us and rigging the telescope to the gate with enchanted copper wire. [[Killian]] pulls the shadewither key out and one of the scientists with Alleli holds the key with gloves and big pincers. She affixes the key to the top of the arch with strands of gold. She makes one last adjustment to the telescope, then looks at us for the go ahead. We give her the go ahead. She closes her eyes and softly chants and through some golden magic effects, a beam of light is shot into the sky and Alleli yells that it's working.

The beam refracts and starts to bounce around the sky and Alleli's smile fades. We see the background start to shift and flicker rapidly through different places that are alien, and she starts adjusting the telescope as she explains that the gate connection has broken and the gate is trying to force another connection. It locks in and we are in a red desert and there is a white ratfolk yelling at us that this is their salvage.

[[Opal]] tries to talk to the ratfolk and convince them we are not here to steal his stuff as [[Killian]] readies his weapon, but the ratfolk doesn't believe him. The ratfolk and his geckos attack, combat begins.

- Ratfolk - Nurl
	- AC: 19
- Geckos - Jessica and Carla
	- AC: 16
	- HP: 20

[[Yuna]] has a sick moment where she one punch woman's one of the geckos (Jessica). Poor thing.

We knock all of the creatures out and Alleli continues to work on the gate. She slaps something and the background shifts again and we appear in an area with spongy flesh-like hills with oozing blisters and forests of what looks like hair follicles. Two black-winged figures take wing and show up before long.

- Nightgaunt
	- AC: 23 or 24
	- *Recall Knowledge* (Hiera): No useful information.

After a rather tedious fight, we manage to to take care of the Nightgaunts. Alleli calls out that we almost have it as she's fiddling with the portal. The horrible flesh goes away and we are on a blasted, ruined planet of rock. There are ruins not too far with bones in it, and a structure made of fused bones. The wind howls as it comes out of the gate, as there is no atmosphere. A few more creatures appear and advance on our position.

The wights are excited we are here as they exclaim that the bone sage rewards them for bringing in "warm bloods."

- Cairn Wight
	- Speak Common!
	- AC: 21ish
	- *Recall Knowledge:* (Opal): No useful information. We might even be on [[Golarion]]. (No we aren't.)
	- Drain HP on attacks to add to temp HP.

We finally take care of the ghouls and tell Alleli we can't take much more of this. We lurch back to the [[Castrovel]] jungle and the gate is filled with a white mist. Through it there is a single stone chamber visible through the portal, and Alleli tiredly clings to the telescope as the portal starts to smolder with waning magic. We rush through the gate and land back on Golarion.

As we enter on Golarion, [[Valentine]] smells something that is familiar to him.
