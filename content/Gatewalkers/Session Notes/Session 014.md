Ria is in a half dream, half reality state. When she became a lion woman there was a connection with the idea of a lion — the overall spirit OF the animal — but that is now gone because there are no lions here. Her body and soul are working to compensate and she feels this intrinsically because she has embraced being part lion whole-heartedly and it’s still there. She lost consciousness because if she let go of the lion she may have taken another form, but she preferred to stay a lion. She’s groggy and still in this dreamlike state. She recalls a person in a mask that was in a dream before and she does not recognize his voice at all. She hears the intention of his words more than his actual voice.

The masked person appears in front of her and she recalls the dream where she chased lions on the savannah. She’s in something similar but it’s all wrong: it’s a jungle, there’s no lions. The person appears before her and tells her that he needs her to be stronger and to get working, she cannot just stay where she is. She asks who he is and what he wants and he chuckles and says that she will not learn that easily. He wants all of them working together on Golarion. She says that she won’t follow orders from some stranger and he says she doesn’t need orders, she needs order in her life, so she needs to go and take it.

Ria comes to consciousness while we are at camp, Ria yelling fuck you as she comes to. Ria notices Yuna and the cultist symbols on her. Ria clearly doesn’t actually trust her but doesn’t attack while Hiera and Killian both vouch that she will not be a problem. We ask if Ria is okay and she says not really but there’s not really anything to talk about. Opal uses crystal healing on Ria and awakens some power in her that neither of them expected and Killian gives Ria a little charm to protect against negative spells.

Opal uses the little statue of the dog to summon a guard dog and uses the command to search on it. As we continue, Opal tells us which way we need to go in order to get where we are going. Opal is in good spirits though because he can’t feel the presence of his family here, so he is really comfortable.

As we continue we walk beneath some trees and there are these weird creatures that are basically half monkeys, half scorpions (tree fisher) that have harpoons attached to filaments attached to their bodies. We take care of the group of three of them.

Yuna and Opal talk about how Opal is Yuna’s favorite best friend and Opal talks about how his brother is possibly looking for him and he’s not a good person. There’s some back and forth with Opal joking that he’s going to live here because he can’t sense his family here, but we all recognize that’s not a real response to the situation. Yuna suggests counseling over his personal issues.

We continue talking and walking and crest a hill to find a stone quarry that moves stones along these powers of pulsing energy.
