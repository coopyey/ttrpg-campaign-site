**Session Date:** 6/24/2023

We come into a storeroom that has:
- Matchsticks
- Healing potions
- Rector of purification (purify food & drink)

There is also a basket attached to a wench system to go to an upper floor.

In the next room over, [[Valen]] hears chewing, laughter, and merriment that clearly is not human. [[Ria]] enters and finds tiny insectoid fey that are bee-like. He knows that these are fey with a big sweet tooth such as honey, nectar, etc. They have an ability called sugar rush that is basically haste for movement. They are called melixie and they attack us on sight.

We take care of them and investigate the kitchen, finding the stove is rigged and explodes. [[Opal]] takes most of the blast, getting absolutely wrecked. [[Valentine]] rushes over and gives opal a healing potion.

By the way,

**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OPAL IS FULL OF BLOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Opal coughs blood on Valentine, who promptly drops him.

[[Killian]] gets into the basket with his familiar, Viktor. They are raised up to the upper area where there is a funnel vessel and water dripping. There are pipes with spigots and controls here. This thing is not safe as there are several pipes that seem to be almost bursting. This is a water tower, the plumbing system. We know that the people here have done a lot of fiddling around.

A jet of water sprays Killian and he jumps back into the basket to go back down. Valen tries to heal him but ~~rolls low~~ doesn't have a sewing kit handy. Killian explains what it was and the group goes back to the textiles room from the mess hall.

There is heavy breathing from the ladder, which leads up. Much of the party enters the room and the heavy breathing person pulls the ladder up, to which Ria tries to catch the ladder and grabs it. Valen shoots an arrow up at the person above. Valentine jumps above and attacks the druid up there. The druid has a pet giant spider named Precious, who attacks Valentine. The druid tries to throw a vial of acid at Ria and misses.

Combat continues, and we eventually dispatch of the druid and Precious. The room was a library at one point, but was converted into a poison lab. Inside, Killian finds:

- 2x shiver — a drug, ingested
- 3x lesser antidote
- 1x cytillesh oil — a poison, melee blades

Valentine takes the shiver to sell, and the cytillesh oil. Valentine, Ria, and Valen each take an antidote.

Valen sneaks up to the door and finds a trap. He tries to disarm the trap with Valentine's help but he doesn't quite get it. We all back up and Valen shoots an arrow at the trip wire, triggering the trap: a violet cloud of poison spills out and then dissipates.

After this, there are no traps so Valen kicks the door open. [[Bolan]] is visible with a sunflower leshy next to the door. He hits Valen with an attack and Valen's legs turn into wolf legs and he misses another attack. We continue fighting and get Bolan down to one knee, where he surrenders.
