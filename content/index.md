This site is meant to include notes for all of the TTRPG campaigns that I'm in. This provides a vault with history for each campaign I've been in, as well as a reference to other players if they miss a session or need to refresh themselves on what happened in a previous session. I would love to have this heavily interlinked with each other so that you can review NPCs or locations and understand the context of what's going on with detail - we'll see if I actually accomplish that. ðŸ˜…

Please be aware that while I type notes my focus is to keep up with the action rather than focus on spelling or grammatical accuracy. I do not always have the time or energy to edit and fix notes, so please be forgiving when reviewing notes and realize that spelling of names may not be consistent, or there may be glaring errors in terms of grammar or sentence structure. I'm doing my best out here. ðŸ’œ

If my DM has a website, I will link to it so that you can see if they have any open campaigns with seats to join. A link to them should be considered as an endorsement and recommendation to play with them.

For art I have a few artists (please commission them!):

- For Faylen, Calthel, and Emerick: my friend [Amelia](https://atelieramelia.carrd.co/) did the art!
- For Killian: my friend [Megu](https://megueggu.weebly.com/) did the art!

All of that said, below is an overview of the campaigns I'm currently in and previous campaigns that are no longer running. You can view the notes to the left in the navigation menu. Thank you for stopping by, I hope you enjoy yourself!

## Active Campaigns
These are in order of start date, so the longest-running campaigns are going to be at the top.
### Stepstone Isles
**System:** Dungeons & Dragon 5E \
**DM:** <a href="https://twitter.com/MattDoyleSmit" target="_blank">Matt Doyle</a> \

### Nuclear Chrome 
**System:** Cyberpunk RED \
**DM:** Ceildread \
**Start Date:** January 19, 2023 \
**Character:** [[Emerick]] Kline; 4 Media \
***Vibe:***
> A cyberpunk horror campaign in which the group works for a ruthless, abusive fixer that only cares about making money at any cost. As in any cyberpunk fiction, everything's terrible all of the time and the group is only trying to make it through the ruthless Night City unscathed. *Please note that Cyberpunk RED is set in 2045 so you will not see Cyberpunk 2077 wireless mechanics such as quickhacking.*

**Vibe:**
> Based on the PF2E adventure path, the characters have wound up in another world after a portal opened in a blinding flash of light.

It is up to them to investigate what happened, get home if they so desire, and solve other mysteries of this world they are in now.

**Start Date:** June 26, 2023 \
**Character:** [[Faylen]] Ianthe; Changeling Elf Laughing Shadow Magus \
**Vibe:**
> Built to be a classic high fantasy adventure, this campaign follows a group of misfits as they attempt to do good and wrangle all of the pieces of a now shattered powerful artifact before it ends up in the hands of ne'er-do-wells. This campaign includes political intrigue, silly cartoonish hijinx, and a group of players doing their damndest to avoid combat in any and all circumstances.
