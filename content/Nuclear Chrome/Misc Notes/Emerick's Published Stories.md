These are a list of stories that [[Emerick]] has actually published. His handle online is **Ghost Light**.

His main blog - **City Whispers** - is a no frills blog that is very straightforward, almost utilitarian in feeling. Each article has its title, date, and time of publishing. There is an abstract as to what the article is about, with a *"Read more..."* button at the bottom of each article abstract. When you choose to read an article, it is clear which articles are the ones that Emerick care deeply about vs. the ones he wrote simply to make sure he could eat that week.

Articles that he cares about are heavily documented with evidence - whether the evidence itself is sound is a 50/50 shot - and written as if the article were a scholarly paper. They tend to be dry and very, very dense. The articles he doesn't care about are considerably shorter and with less supporting documentation - think something more akin to a Buzzfeed article.

Along the side of the blog is a navigation pane that links to a handful of side blogs, the most notable one being a blog called **Nine Lives**. This is a blog that is filled with hijinks of people he appears to know doing absolutely ridiculous stunts and somehow living through them. (We, the group, lovingly call this "Stupid Shit Garf's Done" as we assume this will primarily be the wacky things that Garf gets up to during session.)

>The opening article posted is an incredible story about someone that Emerick knows that jumped out of a moving van to try to dismount a biker that was chasing them. The attempt in its purest form was a failure, but she did live through the impact and survived the encounter to successfully obtain her brand new bike.
