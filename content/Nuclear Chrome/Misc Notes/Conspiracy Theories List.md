A list of some of the ideas I've had as conspiracy theories for [[Emerick]] to dig into to possibly write articles about.

- [ ] All synthetic meat is made of Biotechnica animal clone rejects
- [ ] All the shower water in the lower class portions of the city is corporate waste water that's been "recycled" to make "fit for use and consumption"
- [ ] Internal Agents allow for corporations to feed subliminal messaging into your subconscious
- [ ] Cyberpsychosis is a kill switch from corporations/government that they will trigger in the even you've learned too much and need to be eliminated
- [ ] Bartmoss is still alive and just waiting to make a comeback (implies that Bartmoss allowed Datakrash to happen intentionally)
- [ ] AI have invaded the highest levels of megacorp management and government and have constructed androids to inhabit that look 100% human
- [ ] The internet post-Datakrash was created by corporations and all information is controlled by them to force and gaslight the masses to believe what they want
- [ ] All attacks on Arasaka Tower are an inside job to increase publicity
