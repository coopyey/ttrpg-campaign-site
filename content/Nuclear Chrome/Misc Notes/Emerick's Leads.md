# Bartmoss & R.A.B.I.D.S.
## Premise

Bartmoss was abducted by corporations to force the Datakrash to happen. This would destroy global communications and avoid future uprisings against the megacorporations and allow them to take control of the world.
## Evidence

- **Detailed Rumor:** in a chatroom a group of people discussed how a person who looked an awful like Bartmoss was on an Arasaka convoy with representatives from Militech, Petrochem, Biotechnica, and MA&F present.
	- For 100 eddies he receives an image of Bartmoss clearly visible. Bartmoss is surrounded by people with their faces obscured. 
	- Emerick also receives a certificate of authenticity.
- **Typical Rumor:** NET traffic near the city center about RABIDS.
	- *Cipher* finds that there eis a lot of traffic coming from the business district.
	- There is discussion of a RABIDS 2.0 project, what to do now after Datakrash and Arasaka having been nuked, how to protect themselves moving forward.
- **Typical Rumor:** A DM from an anonymous source with a video of the aforementioned picture - Emerick gets the van plate number from the picture above.
	- Owner is [[Girish Mohan]].
	- The plate has been registered for 10 years. The van was headed to the badlands, and Girish was arrested a few days ago.
	- Ticket:
		- **Crime:** aggravated assault with motor vehicle, resisting arrest, 1st degree murder, intent to traffic an individual, blackmail
		- **Arresting Officer:** [[Miranda Vasquez]]
		- **Comments:** Sped away from the traffic stop, attempted to run Miranda off the road. Ultimately t-bones a cruiser and kills co-cop, Shane Harrison. Being held at Miranda's precinct until investigation is finished.
- **Detailed Rumor:** On TV Eemerick sees an ad for Arachnid Robotics and their new stealth drone for hacking the NET.
	- Emerick recalls that RABIDS 2.0 was reverse engineered 10 years ago and, after some research, he finds the concept for the ebot on TV and find a name attached to it: [[Ida Mueller]].
	- There eis an Invention fair later in the year with no date set yet. The prize for creating a winning AI-drone or invention is a spot on her team.

# Jode Pack (On Behalf of Omen)
## Premise

Omen has asked Emerick to look into a [[Night City Police Department]] raid on the nomad [[Jode Pack]]. The raid happened ~5 months ago. He wants any information that Emerick can find, but especially who specifically gave the order to do the raid.
## Evidence

- Starting with the arrest records from around that time, Emerick finds five people were arrested. They are summarized as:
	- **Affiliation:** Jode Nomad Pack
	- **Crime:** (these are all petty, bullshit crimes)
	- **Arresting Officer:** [[Miranda Vasquez]] 
	- **Description:** (not much, but date matches the raid)
- Emerick also finds that Miranda has been an officer for six years. She has been denied promotion to police chief several times as well. Four of her six years of service has been on the NCPD raid response team, and she's stationed at the district closest to nomad territory in and around the city.
	- Emerick finds that she has been passed over promotion because of the now current chief, [[Audun Bredall]].
- Audun operates with a real iron fist and is a hard-ass. He's on trial for faked cyberpsycho attacks in the last two years, but the government is really dragging their feet on the trial. Leaving him as chief is in their best interest, but people (the public) are overall getting upset about this, especially over the false imprisonments and deaths of family members.
