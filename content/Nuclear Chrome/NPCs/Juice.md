The band manager for [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]], he is interested in getting CSWV to the #1 spot and teaching [[Nuclear Chrome]] a lesson.

Prolific drug dealer, not a nice guy. It is becoming increasingly clear that he provides drugs to the band to keep them complacent so they do not try to get rid of him - they must make him money, or something, as that seems to be all that he is interested in.
