A young woman with hot pink hair in a mohawk.

Posted a story a few months ago that [[Emerick]] recalled:
>A local politician was exposed for being corrupt and doing the job wrong. What was eye-catching about the story was the video that went with it: it was chaotic and reckless, but clearly intentional. She had been interrogating the politician, and at the end of it she blew out the window of his penthouse and then pushed him out of the window to his death. 

She is a wanted criminal with a crimestat of 2.
