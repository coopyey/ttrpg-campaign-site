**Full Name:** Seo Tae-Woo

**Class:** Rockerboy, Corpo(?)

One of the twins of [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]], this is the well put-together brother to [[Ri]].

He is inclined to being up early, is always well-kept with effort put in, everything seems to be put very well together.  He is a very kind closeted gay - he has homophobic parents that had his entire life planned out for him, whether he wanted it or not. *His parents are associated with [[Merril, Asukaga, & Finch]].*

Known Cyberware:
- Pop-up weapon, SMG

To Emerick ONLY:
>Has admitted that he has been forging paperwork for a company that he is meant to be running. The company is an abject failure, but Seo continues to forge the paperwork to make it look like it's doing fine in order to keep his parents' money. *He has asked Emerick to help continue fabricating this documentation as the toll of it, taking care of his brother, and the band, is too much.*

Emerick and Seo have started dating, but are currently keeping it a secret. The main goal is to keep it a secret from Juice and Ogre, and Emerick is generally over cautious. The entire band is aware, and, thanks to high Emerick, the entire party is aware of or at least suspects this.
