**Full Name:** Charley "Combustion" Cook

**Class:** Rockerboy

Leader vocalist and general leader of [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]]. 

He has some sort of beef with [[Juice]], though to most of the group is may be hard to see what it is. In addition, he seems to either want to butter the group up, or keep them generally complacent in all that's going on.

He has privately approached Emerick and has asked for helping finding a replacement for Juice. While the band is in no position to get rid of Juice right now, Charley recognizes that Juice is very bad for the group and was a mistake.
