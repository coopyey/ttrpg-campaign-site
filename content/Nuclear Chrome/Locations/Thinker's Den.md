The hangout for [[The Thinkers]].

You look around, you find yourself standing in a small abandoned warehouse. However it’s since been inhabited by Netrunners. You find three desks, each looking different than the last, unique to its user.

The first desk is messy, energy drinks cans sit on its surface. Papers and wires scattered about, and sticky notes stuck to almost every surface. Each a reminder to do a task that has since been forgotten. This desk obviously belongs to [[Josh]].

The next, is well kept, clean, and organized. A pinboard sits on the wall next to it. Red pins and yarn seem to be tracing the path of something, however it’s hard to tell what. Pictures of a taller, red haired Asian-American woman and what seems to be her family. This seems to be [[Harper]]’s Desk.

The final desk looks less lived in, like most of what was there had been moved somewhere else. However, the desk has two pictures sitting amongst the organized chaos. A picture of Cody and Mama Rosa, the other a picture of him and his boyfriend on a typical date. This is obviously [[Cipher]]’s Desk.

Among other things, you find makeshift tubs. However all that sits is pools of water. Along the walls are maps and posters from around the city, spray painted art all along the walls. It’s quite roomy, as if it was meant for more people to occupy the space. It felt almost empty however, like a looming pressure sits at its doorstep. All that remains is the buzzing of lights and silence. (edited)
