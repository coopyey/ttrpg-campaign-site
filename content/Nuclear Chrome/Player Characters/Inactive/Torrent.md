Owes someone money, and so works for [[Juice]] to manage paying that off.
# Additional Notes
Accidentally killed her mom while performing surgery while still learning, so has surgery related trauma. It happened in Old Japantown so she will not step foot there.

Would like to move to Japan after her debt is paid off, and asked Emerick to go with her.
