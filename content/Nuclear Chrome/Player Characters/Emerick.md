# Class Information
## Media (4) - Credibility
The media role ability is credibility. The media not only can convince an audience of what they publish, but also has a larger audience the more credible they are. They also have greater levels of access to sources and information. Medias are also in the know and pick up on rumors passively.
### Rumors
Medias are deeply plugged into information networks. Assuming you aren't entirely off-grid, at least twice per week the GM will secretly roll your Credibility Rank + 1d10. If the roll beats any of the DVs on the rumor table's passive column, the GM will clue the media in on the highest DV rumor which their check beats. There are some rumors that a media might find by hitting the street during gameplay using their relevant information gathering skills like library search, conversation, or interrogation. An active roll is **appropriate STAT + skill + 1d10** against the DV on the active column.

| Rumor       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Passive DV | Active DV |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Vague       | The rumor is hazy. It contains the bare minimum of information required to start hunting down the supposed truth at the core of it.                                                                                          | 7          | 13        |
| Typical     | The rumor is enough to know where to go next in an investigation. It contains enough information to get a passing glimpse at the supposed truth at the core of it.                                                           | 9          | 15        |
| Substantial | As typical rumor, but the rumor additionally contains concrete information that is beneficial to a potential investigation, like names, places, and times.                                                                   | 11         | 17        |
| Detailed    | As substantial rumor, but the rumor additionally contains information that, if verified, could become a piece of evidence the media can use in a story they might publish about the supposed truth at the core of the rumor. | 13         | 21        |

Rumors, by nature, are often untrue, and are never the full story. Finding the truth is the media's job. Additionally: *some threads are dangerous to pull.*
### Publishing Stories
**Access/Sources** represent those you can reasonably get in touch with/interview or otherwise gain information from.

**Audience** is how many people your stores or exposés can reach.

**Believability** is how well your story or exposé goes over with your audience. The higher your credibility, the more likely people will believe what you have written. You roll 1d10 based on your believability when you publish a story and any time you want to find out whether an individual or group believe your story. Evidence also effects this:
- One piece of verifiable evidence that is easily understood equals +1 to believability.
- Four pieces equals +2 to believability.
These bonuses stack with each other. LUCK can never be spent on a believability score.

**Impact** is how much change any individual story or revelation published has on your audience. For example: a story about an unfair economic practice at the incremental level might just get a few local businesses to change their practices, but at higher levels of credibility, an exposé may cause entire Megacorporations to fall. Once you publish a story you cannot publish another story on the exact same topic unless you have new information to add to the conversation.
### Rank 3 and 4
**Access/Sources:** City gang honcho, minor politician, Corp Exec, well known person in the neighborhood

**Audience:** You're well known as a contributor on the local screamsheet or Data Pool.

**Believability:** 3 out of 10 chance the audience buys it.

**Impact:** Change created by a story has a direct effect: local small-time bad guys get arrested or thrown out of power, justice gets served.
# Personality
On the surface, he’s a very attentive, thoughtful, and kind. He pays attention to details about people and likes to do whatever he can to make them happy and make people like him. This causes him to keep track of things like when peoples' birthdays are, what they like and dislike, and cater to them. 

Ultimately, he is a people-pleaser and a coward. He generally cannot say no to someone and is prone to freezing in stressful situations, especially if he is caught between doing what is told vs. what he knows is right or what he really wants to do. He is very conflict avoidant and will do anything at all to try to make everyone in the room happy.
