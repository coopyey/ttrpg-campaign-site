His ears are pierced, and he has freckles on his face and all over his body. His fingernails are also painted more often than not, any color that strikes his fancy that week or that someone requests.

He is typically unkempt, but not dirty. It is clear that if he were to take care of his appearance he would be handsome, but he throws himself too much into his work to really bother with cleaning himself up.
