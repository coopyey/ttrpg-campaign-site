His ears are pierced, and he has freckles on his face and all over his body. His fingernails are also painted more often than not, any color that strikes his fancy that week or that someone requests. He is typically unkempt, but not dirty. It is clear that if he were to take care of his appearance he would be handsome, but he throws himself too much into his work to really bother with cleaning himself up.

# Personality
On the surface, he’s a very attentive, thoughtful, and kind. He pays attention to details about people and likes to do whatever he can to make them happy and make people like him. This causes him to keep track of things like when peoples' birthdays are, what they like and dislike, and cater to them. 

Ultimately, he is a people-pleaser and a coward. He generally cannot say no to someone and is prone to freezing in stressful situations, especially if he is caught between doing what is told vs. what he knows is right or what he really wants to do. He is very conflict avoidant and will do anything at all to try to make everyone in the room happy.
