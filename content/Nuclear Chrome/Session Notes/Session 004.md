We begin back in combat, with [[Omen]] flooring in reverse to hit the guy attacking [[Garf]].

We dispatch of the baddies. Garf grabs one of the bikes and we make it back to the safehouse. Net gets two of the cases of smash with Cipher taking the last one. Powder and Alice are waiting for us, and Alice is so glad we're back (or that we have beer). We return the cars to the garage.

[[Net]] asks [[Alice]] for some smokes on the down low - something Emerick definitely hears, and notices that Net wants kept on the dl.

As we enter the safehouse [[Seo]] is on the couch reviewing a screamsheet and Alice puts the smash on the table. There is a scuffle upstairs that sounds like some light fighting. Torrent sprints upstairs and hears [[Juice]] talking, clearly expressing to someone they had better have "all of it" next week. When asked, Juice clarifies that the next shipment is coming.

[[Emerick]] asks if everything is okay and Charles says that it's all fine. Emerick knows it 100% is not but says nothing, simply staring at him for a moment too long, then shrugs and says okay. During this exchange, Net does get a cigarette from Alice, and then introduces [[Cipher]] to everyone.

Alice: rockerchick with a tank top, shorts, boots, cuffs.

Screamsheet:
>Tech startup: chip to change everything! Early tests of the Rayfield being made.

Seo offers the screamsheet to Emerick to read, who takes it and reviews it while [[Torrent]] harasses Cipher about idol music. Emerick notices this and encourages Torrent to show him the idol music instead, and leave Cipher alone.

Omen goes and talks to [[Ogre]], who explains that he is a body guard and killing our enemies is very good protection.

News:
>A concert for [[Nuclear Chrome]] shows an exec being brought on stage and executed before the cloud simply for the hell of it.

Ever since the band was financed by [[Merril, Asukaga, & Finch]] the news only seems to report on them when it comes to music. They started to execute rockerboys and execuutives when shit hit the fan and CSWV rose up against them. Whoever they were at the start, they are not that now: someone else is pulling the strings.

Garf goes into the garage and [[Crack Pipe]] asks if the bike is hers. She says yes, and then asks if they have the spare parts needed to repair the bike. She also wishes to replace the [[Nuclear Chrome]] logo with her own nomad pack, the [[Mercury Riders]]. She explains that she was in Vegas for about 6 months and she stops talking as she momentarily dissociates. Crack Pip offers her a joint, but she declines.

Net comes in and Garf explains what it is she is wanting to do and he starts smoking. They work together to remove the plate and get things set up for a paint job. Somewhere along the way, Garf starts having an existential crisis about being a cat, and [[Powder]] takes her for a therapy session.

In the kitchen, [[Emerick]] sits with [[Ri]], who has a pop-up knife that he stabs into a bag of synth-coke. He takes a hit right there, with Alice joining them at the table and telling Emerick not to mind Ri.

Around dinner time everyone gets together. Cipher notices that Net has been smoking and takes them, giving them back to Alice.

New Job:
>*We are to steal a shipment that is being transported. There will be three vans escorted by two armored cars as well as bikers, with total forces greater than twenty people. We are going to be stealing equipment from several smaller bands. The shipment will be in transit in a few days, then held for a few days, with pick up being sporadic pending each individual bands' schedule. The best window of opportunity will be Wednesday or Thursday next week - it's Friday right now - with all of the sets gone by Saturday. It will be one convoy, with no exact date except that all of the stuff will be in the warehouse by Friday.* 

The payout is very generous: 2,000 eddies per person if we manage to get 2 full sets of equipment (6 guitars, 2 drum sets).

Garf has a plan: she wants to take out the armored vehicles and then deal with the bikes. We agree overall, but will need time to formulate the plan of attack.

Cipher decides he wishes to leave and Juice offers to send Ogre with him to ensure he gets home safe. Juice also threatens us with force: if we bitch out, or if we don't get the two sets, we don't get paid.
