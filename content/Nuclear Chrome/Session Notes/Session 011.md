**Session Date:** 3/30/2023

Bruce is scaling the outer wall of the warehouse. Alarms are sounding, and the Bozo car is crashed and unsalvageable. He is intent on getting the others out of the mess he made. He scales the wall and climbs some railing. He surveys around himself to see that about 60 feet behind him and around 200 feet in front of him are snipers standing by, already aiming at hime. Below are about eight guards with ARs readied and looking up at him. In the distance coming from the warehouse is the boss.

Bruce climbs his way across the wall to a window and tries to get in, but he falls to the ground. He gets up and moves to a nearby ground-level window. He manages to punch out the glass on this one and studies the reinforcement, then tries to pry it open.

Combat ensues. Bruce is narrowly missed by the snipers as he starts working on the window again. He is hit by a sniper and suffers a broken right arm, then gets hit pretty hard by the approaching guards. He manages to get the window open and climbs in, landing on the floor. There are two guards but they have not noticed Bruce yet, though they are definitely on high alert. There is not much cover here: he has to get past these two guards in order to get to cover.

He is shot again and attains a torn muscle when trying to dodge the shot, then goes into a mortally wounded state as two guys from outside crawl through the window and shoot at him. He gets back up and manages to grab a guard and use him as a human meat shield. More guards come around and all five of the guards fire at him, laying into him and mortally wounding the poor guard acting as Bruce's shield.

Bruce exclaims he won't let them kill everyone again, then continues pushing forward as the guards kill the human shield, which goes limp as he dies. Bruce drops the corpse, which causes the guards to fire on him directly. He gains another torn muscle, has one hand shot off, and he gains a spinal injury.

As he's dying, Bruce says:

*"I'm sorry, father."*

He falls to the ground and dies.

[[Omen]] was hiding behind some shipping containers as [[Garf]] and [[Net]] were escorted to the Militech boss. He texts Net and Garf and asks if he should help distract the guards, and Net says he should leave if he can, absolutely do not engage. Garf says she already has a plan to smooth this over and fix things.

Omen tries to sneak towards the office and his caught, so he stops and raises his hands as the guards approach. He says he was distracted and got separated, so the guard handcuffs him and takes him to the back office. He's pushed into the office, trips, then gets up and looks around the room. It's not long before Garf lashes out at everyone and Omen realizes he is the only one that is handcuffed.

Garf wants to call [[Snowball]] but Net is against calling anyone else. Garf reminds Net it's his fault they are in here, and the two of them argue about what to do. Garf eventually just calls Snowball, despite Omen and Net both feeling that this is an awful idea.

Omen and Net think about things more and notice there is a duct system. Maybe they can make it to a nearby door and pry it open, or use this to try to find another exit.

(The voice of the narrator comes comes through on the wind to admit that I zoned out really hard for a while because everyone was arguing about the best way to approach getting out of here, but Garf **did** eventually call Snowball.)

---

Garf finally calls Snowball, and calls in the favor that Snowball owes her. She explains what is going on and what kind of resistence to expect, and Garf explains to stay back until she texts and that they have maybe 5-10 minutes. Garf explains all of the looting opportunities and asks that if she dies, get Net out at all costs. *Snowball will arrive and be ready in 10 minutes, with a crew.*

As they wait for Snowball they notice the gunfire has gone completely silent.

As they wait, the office door opens abruptly as guards and the boss enters the office. They bring Bruce's corpse in and asks if they know who he is.

[[Emerick]] and [[Seo]] are stunned as Bruce drives the Bozo car into the front of the warehouse. The two decide to bail on the stakeout as shit starts to hit the fan, and Seo calls a combat cab as Emerick texts Omen asking what the fuck is going on. Omen rapidly explains that things have gone very wrong, and they told Bruce not to do this.

Seo let's Emerick know he's called the cab and Emerick is nonverbal as he helps pack everything up. They load up the combat cab and get in. The ride is tense, but the silence eventually breaks as Emerick starts to question what the fuck happened. He and Seo talk a little, with Seo comfortingly resting a hand on Emerick's shoulder. Emerick is overall pessimistic about the chances of Omen, Garf, Net, and Bruce's survival, but Seo is still hopeful they will be okay. Emerick doesn't believe in miracles, though.

They make it back and unload the cab and start to head inside, but Seo stops Emerick to explain that *every day all of the good times are miracles.* It's clear from the way Emerick hardens and grows guarded that this both rubs him the wrong way, and that he doesn't believe it. Seo asks if they should sit down and get the story straight before they have to talk to [[Juice]], but Emerick says he can talk to Juice and Seo doesn't need to join him. Seo respects it and leaves to go to his room.

Emerick drops his own stuff off at his own room, then knocks on the door to Juice's office. The office opens a little and it is obvious that Juice, [[Alice]], and [[Charley]] are having a conversation. Juice asks what is going on and Emerick admits that the job has gone sideways. Juice kicks the others out of his office and tells Emerick to come in and sit, which he does. Juice demands he explain.

Emerick gives a rundown of what happened and Juice is clearly pissed, asking why the fuck they didn't just obey orders. He drags a syringe across Emerick's face and demands that Emerick prove that he is useful. Emerick says he does have a video of Bruce driving the car into the security checkpoint.

He also explains that Omen and Garf wish him harm. Juice wants to see the video of Bruce, so Emerick sends it over to him, and Juice watches it. He bitches about the fact that he has to be careful of who he hires in the future.

It's in this moment that Juice realizes that Emerick is not a fighter, but is far more keen on gathering information. Juice offers to go into a partnership with Emerick, and would be willing to help him chrome up. He tells Emerick to rest and be ready for an all-hands meeting once the others arrive, if they do.

Emerick leaves the office with Juice's permission, and returns to his room where he tries (and fails) to sleep.
