After the conversation with his uncle, Net really wants a cigarette. He shakes it off and moves on with his day, stopping at a corner store to get some mint gum (spearmint). He chews it and goes to meet [[Trash Tablet]]. 

Tab asks how he's been, and Net says he's been, he exists. He explains that he's over the blue glass and asks if Tab's heard from [[Javier]] at all. A member comes up and gives Tab a phone, and Tab asks if Net spoke to Javi, and Net confirms that he did about half an hour ago. Javi just texted and mentioned Net: *If you see Net, tell him he is welcome to one favor from the gang.*

Net hands the phone back. For once, Net shuts the fuck up and doesn't know what to say. He tells Tab to pass along that he's grateful.

As Net is leaving, [[Mam√° Rosa]] fins Net and holds him there in a conversation for at least an hour, which is is just thrilled about.

Omen has the stolen van, which he got from Little Europe. On the way back he gets a message from his cousin, who stumbled onto some information involving the raid:
>[[Miranda Vasquez]]'s been making rounds around there, and there have been some bad firefights that have happened. She isn't sure of the specifics, but something is happening, and her partner is possibly dead. They were chasing an SUV throughout town.

Omen says he will ask the others about this to see if they know anything. He then gets the van to [[Phoenix]]'s safehouse and waits for Net.

Phoenix offers to take Garf to dive into the net at the facility to get an idea of the network. [[Torrent]] goes along with them.

[[Omnitech Industries]]' building isn't particularly imposing. Phoenix says we can go into the building as an employee, or go into the lobby to see what is there. Phoenix explains that *uniforms are not the biggest deal to have* so we could go in as fake employees. Garf opts for the lobby.

The lobby is rather extravagant: two fountains, two sitting areas, a central desk, and an office in the back. There are doors on the left as well.

Phoenix gives Torrent and Garf radio communicators before they enter the building.

Phoenix sits in one of the sitting areas and tells Garf to go do her thing. Garf goes up to the receptionist and asks where the restroom is. Garf and Torrent go to the restroom and Garf looks around for a vent, but it is reinforced. Garf then runs a scan for an access point: the only one that is nearby she can see and reach is in the office. Garf recalls they have the employee cards and go to the elevators and go up to the first floor. Once on the first floor, Garf asks Torrent to make the guard go away.

Torrent goes out and does a fantastic job acting like she doesn't know where the restroom is and asking the guard to show her where it is. The guard takes Torrent into the elevator to take her down to the restroom.

Garf does a pathfinder and sees part of the architecture, then works on getting through it.

---

Torrent is escorted by the guard down to the restroom. She runs inside and stays there for a few minutes, acts like she has a stomach ache and is in pain, and then stays there a little while longer. She walks out and groans that this is such a bad day.

The guard that had escorted her down had left before she made the first groan of pain to go talk to the receptionist. The guy in the office yells at the guard and the receptionist, then goes to the restroom and pretends he doesn't see or hear anything.

Torrent waddles out to the receptionist and asks how to take a sick day, and the receptionist gives Torrent the phone number to Omnitech HR.

---

Net checks his phone and Omen had a ton of texts with Net, and they establish that Net is actually alive. He shows up at Phoenix's to meet up with Omen. They begin work on the van. Net opens the glovebox and finds a pack of cigarettes. He considers them, then takes the pack and opens it. There is nothing inside and he leans back in the seat and yells, "son of a fucking bitch!" He throws the box, and it happens to hit Omen.

Net shoves four pieces of gum in his mouth because he wants a cigarette. Omen offers to finish the van up on his own, and to listen to Net if Net wants to talk about things. Omen explains that his family is scattered and he only knows where his cousin is. Net would like Omen to know that *he doesn't give a shit.* Omen continues to talk just to make noise for Net to zone out to. When he finishes, Net says they need to finish it up.

Of note, Net has a -2 on all rolls until he smokes a cigarette or overcome his addiction.

Emerick heads back to the safehouse. [[Alice]] gets up and leaves as Emerick approaches, and Emerick stops to chat a little with [[Charley]]. Charley explains that Alice doesn't know what to do around us, nor does she know how to interact with us. Because of this she is being aloof and reserved, which Emerick can understand.

Charley asks how Emerick is doing, and emerick explains he will be okay, and that he's been thorugh worse. Charley nods and says if he needs anything to let him know and Emerick says of course, with a genuine smile.

Emerick heads in and heads toward [[Seo]]'s room, stopping when [[Powder]] calls out to him. He greets her and answers her question, and also says he's doing okay. She says there is a secret: **they have a show coming up!!!** Emerick promises he won't tell anyone else until it's announced. [[Ri]] rolls his eyes and says that Powder has been telling everyone, so it's not really a secret. Emerick says that it's still very exciting that they'll be playing soon, which Ri agrees. Emerick admits that he's looking forward to it and is very excited for [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]].

He finally pulls away and makes it up to Seo's room. The door is cracked, but Emerick still tentatively knocks. Seo answers and the two flirt with each other a little. It is mostly Seo that's doing the flirting because Emerick is still astonished that they are in a relationship together, actually dating. Seo invites Emerick inside.

Emerick admits that he's not just here for a social call, but he has a favor to ask of Seo, explaining that he needs to fabricate a fake company with a website and a forged shipment invoice. With four hours of work, they created the website and invoices needed. Seo also suggests getting a burner phone and setting it up as a dummy inbox for the job: it adds a level of legitimacy without being tied to anyone, and nobody has to actually answer the phone. Emerick likes this idea, and Seo says he'll take care of it for  them.

When all is said and done, Emerick stays to hang out with his boyfriend. üòè

In the middle of her netrun, Garf goes limp as she starts tripping on blue glass.
