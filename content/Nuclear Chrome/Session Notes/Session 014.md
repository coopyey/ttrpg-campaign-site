A week passes after the last session.

---

[[Esperanza]] asks what is going on and [[Net]] says not to worry with [[Cipher]] saying that he will keep Net out of trouble. She says to keep clean, no body bags, and then offers the boys a place to lay low if necessary.

---

[[Omen]] goes to see his cousin. She is alone here, so Omen takes his helmet off fully. He tells her that the may have a lead on the raid and explains that Officer [[Miranda Vasquez]] and her superior, [[Audun Bredall]], seem to be the issue here. Omen says he plans to follow that up. He asks if she has found anything and she says no, but what Omen has is great work.

He says that things are fine, and he's getting along, but she can tell he's lying. She asks if there is anything she can do to help, and he explains that he is seeing the truth of Night City and how shitty it is. She has not found any of the clan, but will let him know if she does find anything.

---

[[Garf]] goes out and fights a hoe to take out her frustration. She wins.

---

[[Torrent]] goes to a ripperdoc to check to see if [[Juice]] implanted any spy cyberware. She's clean. She gives [[Katchya]] a hug, and then leaves.

---

We all receive a text from [[Charley]]. He apologizes for how things are, and he recommends that we go to  [[The Afterlife]] to get a few drinks. We all agree and meet him.

He's sitting at the bar, but has a back room for us to speak in a quieter, more private setting. Torrent and [[Emerick]] are the first to arrive, followed closely by Garf and Omen, and then Net and Cipher.

Emerick gets a smash, and buys Omen a drink (at Omen's insistence). Garf gets a shot of Everclear. This inspires Emerick to take a shot of vodka, then he joins Omen and Garf in going to the back room. Net and Cipher show up and Net gets a spiked coffee, with Cipher refusing to say anything to Charley at all. They are going to party and Charley agrees, then promises that the drugging will not happen again.

We all make it to the private room and find that the rest of the band is there. [[Ri]] and [[Alice]] are already very intoxicated, and [[Seo]] is 100% sober. Torrent sits on a bar stool and spins, and Emerick is sitting next to Seo, who specifically waved at him. :>

Alice glares at Cipher when he enters.

We all get settled in and Charley apologizes to all of us for what happened. He admits that he and the band don't want us hurt, and they eventually do not wish to work under [[Juice]]. Alice, Ri, and Seo speak up and say that we are doing a great job, and they want for us to stick around. Charley explains that he will find a replacement for Juice and we will continue to get paid, but he is concerned about all of what he needs that Juice currently provides. He explains they do **not** have any plans as of yet. Charley hopes that there is no bad blood between us all.

After this, we sit around and socialize for a while until [[Ogre]] steps in, with Juice just behind. Ogre pulls a very heavy pistol, and Juice says that he doesn't care how we all feel about him. He knows that we all hate him, but he is the one that pays us all. 

Juice is here to discuss the mission: he is very unhappy. The surprise shipment wasn't our job and the shipments all ended up getting AVs and drone support. Militech really upped security after what happened, so there is no point in trying for the equipment anymore. He says **do not show off** and if that's what you want to do, **don't bother showing up.**

He leaves, and we all split off to do our own thing.

---

Torrent drags Charley off to talk in a bathroom. She calls him stupid and asks why he would talk about killing Juice off in a public place. Charley says he did not mention mention anything to Juice while present, and the walls are sound proof. He explains Juice would be able to guess we were here regardless.

Torrent says she isn't thrilled at everything going on, and Charley says she doesn't need to be involved if she doesn't have to be. He eventually recommends drugging Juice and Ogre.

---

Alice, Ri, and Garf are playing blackjack.

Basically: Garf bets her bike and $20,000 to recoup all of the money she'd lost, and to really up the ante. In an incredible play, she wins.

Alice and Ri wish Garf a good game and leaves. She checks the credchip that Alice gave her and it is real, but only for $1,000.

(I zoned out during this but I know that Ceil settled the final amount of $2,000 total winnings.)

---

Emerick takes a few shots, and then Seo suggests that they head back to the safehouse together. Seo clearly wants to help Emerick and make sure he's okay, and Emerick finally gives in to it. They leave together and on the cab ride back, Emerick tells Seo about what he's found regarding his story with Bartmoss and R.A.B.I.D.S. (Refer to [[Emerick's Leads]].)

---

The rest are doing karaoke. Cipher sings *House of the Rising Sun,* Net sings Abba's *Dancing Queen*, and Garf sings *Death Metal Pizza*. The band also sings.

While everyone else is about to leave, they are approached by a gal with hot pink hair in a short mohawk and reinforced clothes. She has a job:
>A contact at [[Omnitech Industries]] has made her aware of rumors going around that they are forcefully testing cybernetics on people. The specific details are muddy, but she thinks there is a story there. The company prides itself on ethics, but there is a rogue scientist working outside of the norm there. It is possibly Dr. [[Markov]], their lead scientist. *The plan is to break in, steal the files, interrogate Markov if needed, and then get out*. Security is tight, but she has a plan or two to deal. Pay will be $500 per file (4 total) and an additional $1,000 for a successful story, so $2,500 per person @ 100% success.

She introduces herself as [[Phoenix]], a media. Net says that they are all too drunk to properly accept at the moment, but they will rest and reach out to her with an acceptance or refusal.
