[[Emerick]] sends a text out to let the party know that the band is headed over to the club [[Tranquil Infiniti]] and he rides with [[Seo]] over to the club. The band and Emerick get there first and we start to set up, talking to the club manager: a respectful man, professional, not a sleezeball. He makes sure we’re all safe and can get set up. [[Charley]] pays the rest of the fee to rent the space to be here.

After the party arrives. [[Garf]] asks [[Cipher]] to grab them a table and to hold it for them, and [[Omen]] arrives around the same time. 

Garf and Emerick go up to the bar — Garf to get a snack, Emerick to get a beer — and Emerick goes to pay, with Garf saying she has it. Emerick is confused and seems unsure what to do, and Garf starts to ask if anyone’s ever bought anything for him, and if he’d ever had a Christmas or anything like that before. Emerick replies that he hasn’t, no, and Garf says she’s going to change that.

General discussions ensue: [[Torrent]] trying to get boxed apple juice and getting it poured in a glass instead, Garf trying to give Torrent a Mac n cheese bite. Emerick slid down the bar to sit closer to [[Alice]] and [[Ri]], who are in their own discussion about some news they hard about other bands, but at least it’s not the argument ensuing between Torrent and Garf about how Mac n cheese bites are disgusting or not.

[[Net]] walks in at this point, collar popped. He looks fucking fly as hell. He sees Emerick awkwardly sitting next to Alice as Alice and Ri are talking, and Garf chasing Torrent around trying to feed her food.

He approaches the bar and asks if they do mixed drinks, and he pulls a slip of paper out of his jacket and hands it to the bartender: the signature drink that Cipher came up with for Net:

The Hellhound is a Cinnamon whiskey, with ginger-ale, grenadine, and cherries (Net’s Drink)

Net is between Garf and Emerick. It’s noticeable that he hasn’t taken off the foundation covering his tattoos. He slowly sips the drink then turns toward Emerick and asks what he can do to help around here. Emerick explains that he’s not sure, perhaps Charley is the best person to ask. Emerick looks around and points out where Charley is so that Net can ask. Charley explains that once people start to come in we can start to mingle and hang out with everyone. Net asks if there’s anything at all he can do to help because he’s in a good mood, so just point out what he can do and he’ll do it for Charley. Charley does admit that it would be awesome if Net could add a little extra flair to the stage, he’s thinking of doing a little performance. Net says he can think of something as long as he can get his hands on the stage to work on it.

People start to trail in as time passes and it’s not long before we’re mingling. Net, for his part, is working on getting a light display set up so that it’ll look real slick when [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]] performance. He does a good job getting things set up and prepped for CSWV.

Alice and Ri’s original conversation dies down and Alice ultimately turns to Emerick and says she’s glad he came and he says of course, he wants to see them succeed, to help them. She buys him another beer and thanks him for it, and Emerick thanks her a few times for it. Alice eventually asks what leads Emerick has at this time, and he lights up and starts to explain his Bartmoss lead while specifically leaving out information on [[Ida Mueller]] and seeing her at the last mission. Ri eventually turns and pays attention to the conversation as well. When Emerick lights up talking about his story Alice also lights up, and she notes that this is the most alive he’s been since joining them.

Charley is mingling with people and sees Net and what he’s done, approaching and saying that Net did a good job and he like sit. Net is modest and says he’s not a stagehand but Charley says that he has talent and he was curious what Net would do. Net excuses himself to go find Cipher and spend time with him.

As Garf tries to feed Torrent a Mac n cheese bite, someone approaches Garf with their friends, saying Garf looks cool. It almost sounds like a very good impersonation of Leonardo from TMNT. There are three exotics that are similar to one of each of the TMNT members, with the fourth still back at the entrance of the club. Garf is absolutely surprised about this development. They talk back and forth and Garf explains that there’s a performance tonight with good music if they wanna stick around for it.

Net joins the conversation and asks how long it took for the surgeries and stuff. They explain that they really enjoyed the TMNT crew and they wanted to pay homage to it.
