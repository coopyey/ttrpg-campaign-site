[[Omen]] is upset as he comes down the stairs. He walks with purpose as [[Seo Tae-Woo]] comes down the hall to join the entire group with a carryall.

----

Omen, Seo, [[Garf]], and [[Emerick]] all pile into cars and head to an abandoned building near the target to stake out the location to try to gain more information about what we will be up against. Emerick and Seo talk on the ride over while Omen drives. There is a car in front of us that rolls out in front of us that is bellowing smoke. Omen and Garf go to drive around it, and Emerick and Seo notice that the car is filled with explosives. Emerick tells Omen and Garf to fucking gun it.

We get past the explosion and a biker zips out of an alley and comes up on Garf, another pulling up to Omen's vehicle on Emerick's side. Emerick notices that the gangers are [[6th Street]], and Garf shoots the hand of the biker next to her. Omen bashes the bike next to us and the rider loses control of the bike, crashing and thus inoperable. Emerick kills the biker next to Garf and they continue on to the stakeout location.

We pick a spot for the stakeout that is not too close to the location (high risk, high reward) but also not too far (low risk, low reward). Omen occasionally leaves us to scout closer to the warehouse, while Emerick and Seo watch over Garf as she netruns and tries to scope out the architecture of this area.

The location we picked is a typical run-down warehouse. It is dilapidated with blown-up cars, bullet holes, and casings everywhere. It is not a pleasant place to be, but it will do. The warehouse for pickup of the equipment is the only warehouse with any activity nearby, while our warehouse is completely vacant (except for us, of course).

[[Net]] and [[Cipher]] make it to [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]]'s warehouse after breakfast and a long conversation with [[Mama Rosa]] demanding that they bring their friends home so that she can meet and feed them all. [[Alice]] and [[Crack Pipe]] are smoking a cigarette, with [[Charley Cook]] and [[Powder]] also there. Crack Pipe tells Net to come by more often so they can work in the shop together. Crack Pipe puts his cigarette out because he knows Net is trying to quit smoking.

Crack Pip tells Net where everyone is. Net asks what is going on with [[Juice]], and Crack Pipe explains that Juice shot Garf. he explains that we are all knew and that the band is fucked with Juice, and without him. The news cycle continues: more missing bands, more band executions ,etc.

[[Ri Tae-Woo]] steps in from the hall, asking what Cipher has brought, and Ri immediately dives in to help Cipher put away all of the food that Mama Rosa sent him out with. Ri is very unkempt to the point of not showering and Net very inelegantly tells him to go fucking clean himself up. Ri doesn't like Net's approach, but when Cipher tries in a more kind manner, he listens and is receptive. Net goes to work on cars.

Cipher takes some food up to [[Torrent]] and offers it to her. She takes it and invites Cipher in, talking nonstop about her music, eventually offering a mix tape to him with some music that he likes. They discuss.

---

In the garage, Net, Powder, and Crack Pipe continue working on the car project. Net reviews the car, and Powder speaks up to say that she's worked on it a lot lately, which Net likes. They work to build up more of the frame, and plan other parts. They discuss the internals and what everyone wants out of it.

Alice pokes in from time to time to chat because she's bored. She wants to be entertained, but she is a party girl, not a greasemonkey. Net tries to engage her and she does actually get a little bit into it. She starts smoking while she is there. Net asks for a cigarette, and Alice has decided that Net owes her for the last cigarette, being rather sassy as she teases him. He asks the price, and Alice says 10 eddies for 3, and he calls her gonk. She says it's his vice, and  then blows smoke in his face. Crack Pipe gives Net a cigarette and he dares her to try to overcharge him again, returning the smoke in her face.

Net tries to pay Crack Pipe, but he refuses, and tells Net to live with it.

Net goes into the kitchen to a very amped up Ri, and a Charley that's just vibing. Ri is going a mile a minute like Torrent, but it's completely nonsensical and disjointed. As Net gets some leftovers, [[Ogre]] and Juice enter.

Juice addresses Net, asking him if he's busy: he needs Net to run an errand for him. Net explains he is working on the car, and Juice promises to get Net something for his trouble. Net agrees to do it, and Juice explains the job. Net explains he isn't desperate enough to deliver drugs, and Juice is displeased. He explains that regardless, Net *must* get Garf a tub and ice for her to netrun, and Net tries to get uppity with Juice. Juice threatens Net, and Net backs down and agrees to help

Charley sends Net 100 eddies a with a note:
>Choom - I know what you're doing, but play nice.

Garf is poking at the NET architecture, eventually finding five levels with:
- a password
- asp
- control node - warehouse cameras
- another password

Because of Garf's netrunning, she keeps the first five floors of the architecture for free. It will take more work if she wishes to go deeper.

While Garf is netrunning, Emerick asks Cipher to check into something for him. Cipher manages to find taht there is a lot of NET traffic around RABIDS from the city center area. He thanks Cipher and keeps this in mind for the future.
