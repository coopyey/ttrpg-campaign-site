[[Juice]] steps out of the van and tells everyone that he isn't happy to be there, and says that they sure did fuck up. He asks what in the fuck is going on. [[Net]] asks if he wants the short or long version, and Juice wants the long.

In summary, Net explains:
- heard of extra shipment, decided to grab it
- explains the general plan & goals
- explains what they found
- explains how Net fucked it up
- explains the bag of what used to be Bruce
- explains no information was given, they were not tracked

Juice asks if the others have anything to add, and [[Omen]] flips him off. [[Garf]] says it's time to do it the fun way. She gesture's for [[Snowball]]'s grenade launcher. There is a delay as Juice says he can help with that and in the blink of an eye, [[Ogre]] is in front of Garf.

Juice says that he will just take care of things. Ogre grabs Garf by the neck. When Snowball moves to try to help, Juice tells her not to do so, because he has the firepower here. Garf falls unconscious.

Omen goes to throw a smoke grenade and Juice says that will not work, and Omen gets shot by a sniper rifle in the torso. Juice asks [[Charley]] to help and he aims his shotgun at Omen, begging him to just go along with this and that he hates this. Net discourages Omen from doing anything rash. Omen stays still while Ogre approaches with a syringe.

[[Torrent]] runs up to Net and motions for his hand, explaining that she wants to hold it so that he doesn't get hurt. He lets her hold it.

Omen realizes that the syringe is filled with *blue glass* and fights against every single instinct he has to allow Ogre to inject him with it. He is immediately hazy as the world bursts into an ever-shifting [kaleidoscope](https://youtu.be/VS0nfKQs_-4) of color.

Juice tells Charley to deal with Garf, then turns to [[Cipher]]. Cipher takes a couple of steps back as Juice approaches. Net shoots Cipher a warning look and tells him to take it. Cipher listens and puts his hands up as Net says Cipher has nothing to do with the botched job, and Juice explains that Cipher is the cause of *all* of this.

Juice asks Torrent to do him a favor and take care of Net, and Torrent tells Net she has a secret she wishes to share with him. She whispers in his ear an apology, and promises to help when this is all over. She leads Net to a chair so that he can sit down, and Net begs Cipher to just go along with all of this. Torrent then injects him.

Cipher straightens up to his full height and tries so hard to keep a brave face. Juice says that this was all because of Cipher, and his need to put the band below him. Juice says he's lucky that this is all he's getting because he doesn't deserve it, but he does have some expired product he picked special for Cipher. Juice leans and says that he sure hops his mom won't miss him, then injects Cipher in the neck.

Everyone is tripping on blue glass. Juice tells Snowball and the others to leave so that they aren't tangled up in all of this, warning that htey will die if they do not leave. They listen.

Everyone is taken back to the safehouse and it is deathly silent. The party is brought in and placed in the living room, too high to function. IN the midst of all of this they hear Juice talking to someone or some people, and can swear [[Emerick]] is talking to someone. They exist like this until they fall asleep, unsure of what is and isn't real.

----

Juice instructs Torrent and Emerick that they are to watch over, and they are given plenty of detox in case something starts happens, as the party will be needed in the future.

Torrent and Emerick talk, with Emerick learning that Torrent has worked for juice for about four years now, starting after she became a medtech. She explains that her parents had quite a bit of debt when they died, so she inherited it and needs to pay it off.

On that topic, she also comments that her mom would have liked Emerick because he is strong, and she says she wished he could have met her. Torrent bursts into tears, with Emerick holding holding her  and comforting her as best as he can. Torrent eventually calms down enough to explain that she likes Emerick and that he's different from the others, and she asks if he would like to go to Japan with her and [[Katchya]]. He says he would like that very much.

---

Eventually everyone starts to stir and there's noise from upstairs. Juice and Charley come down and start talking. Juice says to get them ready as Torrent and Emerick start to wake. Charley starts moving everyone, and things are a blur before everyone actually wakes up.

---

Cipher and Net wake up at [[MamÃ¡ Rosa]]'s house. Cipher flings the mask off of his face and starts to frantically look through the entire house in a panicked frenzy. Net stumbles out and calls out a good morning to MamÃ¡ Rosa.

Cipher asks who dropped them off and she says that Charley did. She explains that she was told they did a job and got really messed up and they brought them home to rest. Cipher hugs her and starts sobbing as Net falls onto the couch and asks what day it is, explaining he doesn't know what's happened for twelve hours. Cipher says MamÃ¡ has to stay with [[Esperanza]], and Net heavily agrees with that.

He starts to explain that his coworkers are not his friends, then begs for her to go stay with Esperanza. He tears up as he begs, and Rosa tears up as well. She calms herself down and squares her shoulders and says she will do anything for him. Cipher wants to know if Charley comes back around, and Net grabs his Agent to scroll through his contacts. He messages [[Trash Tablet]] to meet at Esperanza's.

Cipher rubs his temples and gives himself a shake to loosen up. He confirms that Esperanza won't mind Rosa staying, and Net stands and says he knows for a fact she won't mind.

Net goes to clean himself up in the bathroom (*insert failed addiction check here*) and his vision starts to swirl and spin as he looks in the mirror. He grabs his head to push his hair back and leans over the toilet and forces himself to vomit. He sits down to calm himself, then calls Trash Tab. To Tab, Net explains that he fucked up, and he fucked up badly. He explains that he was drugged and asks if Trash Tab recalls the guy addicted to glass. Net asks if that will happen to him, and he is met with silence before Tab reassures him there is hope. Net gets up to head to Esperanza's.

Net and Cipher spend a moment of comforting each other, and Cipher reminds Rosa to stay with Esperanza or [[Josh]] if something bad happens.

[[Omen]] and [[Garf]] wake up on the couches in the safehouse.

Omen shoots awake, then goes and pats Garf to make sure she's alive. Garf and Omen start talking with each other, with Garf explaining she feels like shit, then asking how they got here. Omen recalls meeting Snowball, and also maybe Net and Cipher?

Omen calls Net, who picks up, and asks what happened. Net says that he's in Heywood, maybe Santo Domingo. He says not to meet them at this time. Neither of them quite knows what's going on at this time, and there's a little bit of back and forth before they hang up. 

Omen then calls Emerick, who explains why he left and that he and [[Seo]] reported what happened to Juice. He did tell Juice what was in the box, and he would rather Juice not kill them over a failed job.

Omen hangs up and stands, the drug suddenly hitting him as his vision spins. He reels and stumbles heavily, fighting the urge to throw up. Garf also stands and her vision also swirls, sending her back down onto the couch as the drug hits her as well.

Garf asks why they are there, and why don't they go back to their nomad packs? Omen explains that he can't right now, his pack is having hard times. Garf then asks what they should do now, and Omen will think about it.

Alice comes out and says Garf and Omen look like shit. Alice is surprised they're partiers like that. They are surprised, and Garf asks Omen to see if he was injected. Garf tries to find a needle mark on Omen, but he struggles against her.

Omen goes to take a shower, and Garf stumbles out to look the date up and then goes to sit on her bike. She stars at the ignition and contemplates leaving.

Omen goes up to Emerick and pushes into his room, asking what happened. Emerick explains that after he gave the report to Juice, he went to sleep. The others were brougt in high, and Emerick and torrent had to watch over them to make sure they were okay. Omen asks how they were drugged, and Emerick says he isn't sure, but he does mention that Juice was talking about a punishment. Omen notices Emerick wasn't drugged, and Emerick mentions that the job is not worth doing at this point.

Omen then moves on to Torrent and asks what happened. She talks about getting a pizza, and Omen agrees. They go and Torrent makes sure nobody is following, and then they go in. Torrent says that this was the *better* option. She says she can't really say much, but we just have to **do our work** and **be quiet**. Omen asks if we need to get the equipment, and she admits that she isn't sure, but it likely isn't a good idea. You can't get what you want if you're dead, after all.

Omen suggests that sometimes you should stick to your morals, and Torrent asks if he's new to this city. He says he is a nomad, and she is surprised. She points out that they don't talk as often, and they should. Torrent manages to convince Omen to buy the pizza. ðŸ˜›

Emerick gets a phone call, and it's Charley. He asks to speak to Emerick in person, and Emerick asks when and where. Charley sends him an address and a time.

Emerick gets dressed and goes out to meet Charley. He finds Charley sitting on a bench, waiting. Emerick sits next to him and the two talk. Charley explains the situation where Cipher attacked Alice, and explains that his ultimate goal is to find a new band manager so that they can replace Juice. He recognizes that Juice was a mistake, but they *are not in a position to be able to function without him* right now.

Emerick agrees to help, and then goes home to vibe to music and dissociate for a while.

---

Emerick and Torrent are waking up on the couch with Juice and Charley coming down the stairs. Juice tells Charley to move everyone, and expresses his dislike of everything going on right now. He goes to his office, and Charley sighs and begins moving everyone. As he takes the last person out, he doesn't come back, leaving.

5-10 minutes pass and Torrent and Emerick sit there uncomfortably, unsure of what to do. They both take it all in and while it's awful, they recognize it's not the worst outcome that could have happened. Juice eventually comes down and tells them to get up and go with him. There is a car waiting for them all, and they get in after Juice.

Juice explains that he is going to tell them both very guarded information. What happened the previous night isn't the end of the punishment. Juice says they are going to a secure location where he is working on a project. Emerick and Torrent have a calm feeling wash over them, almost growing emotionless.

Juice continues and says that he needs the two of them to play a role in this, and they can't fuck this up. He says that they will all be put in some experimental tech and they have to play along with it. When they wake up they can go back to their lives without any issue. Torrent and Emerick start to grow drowsy, eventually passing out.

The two of them come in and out of consciousness over the span of a few hours, seeing glimpses of labs and people and computers. Someone talks about something, seeming the authority of all of this, and the two zone out again. They are eventually tied down to some chairs and they don't know what's going on, eventually falling asleep to unpleasant dreams. Their lives are stripped away and they are unaware of where they are or what is happening.
