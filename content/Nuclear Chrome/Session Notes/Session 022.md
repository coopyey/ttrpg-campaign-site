Wednesday August 9th, 2045 -> Friday August 11th, 2045

[[Emerick]] had told the group that we need to leave. [[Cipher]] jacks out unsafely and is seriously hurting. There’s a moment before [[Garf]] finally jacks out of the architecture as [[Net]] picks Cipher up to carry him. [[Phoenix]] says it’s time to go and [[Omen]] tells us to get the elevator open while he signals to Torrent to wrap things up. Net is acting like Cipher tripped and rolled an ankle. The guards ask about it and Net explains.

As we are in the elevator, right about to the lobby, Emerick hears a lot of shuffling on the floor here. He mentions it and says it sounds almost like it’s an ambush, possibly, of some kind. He explains that he hears people shuffling things around. Omen rolls out a few smoke grenades and we quickly hustle through the lobby on the way out. We get near the loading dock and Omen chokes out a surprised employee so that she stops screaming. We make it into the loading dock itself.

We open the door and there’s a guard next to the desk and he’s smoking a cigarette. He doesn’t seem to be paying attention and we all start to walk past him, acting cool. He nods at us and waves us off as we continue. We get into the van and we see his earpiece is one of the cushions on the couch, realizing that this guy is entirely unaware of what is going on. We proceed to leave as if nothing happened. As we are leaving, we see all the guards rushing out of the dock door and into the shipping dock — we are already on the street and away to safety.

Net looks to [[Torrent]] and asks her to help Cipher, asking her to stab him. Torrent stabs him excitedly, putting a bandaid on it. Net is in the “oh shit” panic mode that he’s ever been in, though Cipher is doing much better now.

Omen drops us all off where all we request to be dropped off at.

Net checks to make sure his tool hand wasn’t bugged (it wasn’t) then he makes sure Cipher is fine. Trash Tablet walks in and asks what the fuck is going on, if anything happened. Net explained he had to rip Cipher out and that it wasn’t business as usual. They talk a little about that and how dangerous it is and then Trash Tablet keeps Net company and chat. Net does a second glance over his hand then stays near Cipher.

Phoenix, Torrent, and Emerick are dropped off at a bar. Phoenix takes a moment to talk to Emerick, who indirectly apologizes that she didn’t get all the data she wanted. She says not to worry about it, keeping the team safe is the better deal and she had enough for the story anyway. Emerick agrees that he looks forward to working with her again and that he’ll get her the video data later tonight.

---

Torrent is hugged by [[Katchya]] when she gets home and she spends 200 years explaining exactly what happened.

As Emerick gets out of the cab, [[Crack Pipe]] and [[Charley Cook]] and [[Powder]] are in the garage. Charley has this concerned look on his face. Emerick can overhear the end of their conversation before they notice him: Charley can’t believe what he’s hearing and they’re talking about what happened with Net. Crackpipe looks at Charley and says that he thinks he’s done with the packs, he can’t do them anymore after seeing Net’s attitude with things. He’s quitting cold turkey. Charley’s expression shifts from disbelief to surprise.

Powder and Crackpipe are looking at Charley as Emerick walks up, and Charley’s attention hasn’t really left what Crackpipe was saying. Powder notices Emerick and runs over and hugs him. Charley and Crackpipe says hi to him and they talk about Net. That conversation winds down and Powder lets go of Emerick to ask what he did today, and he explains vaguely what the job was, talking about how they were getting data for a story for another media.

Alice is sitting on the couch watching the news and Emerick catches the end of a breaking news story: [[Omnitech Industries]] heist gone wrong. There’s no media release of who the people were and for some reason, Omnitech isn’t releasing our names or pictures, no warrants, nothing like that: it’s as if they didn’t want a story to get out.

Emerick gets his laptop and a smash and sits next to [[Alice]] on the couch, editing the video for Phoenix while she watches tv. Everyone eventually retires for the evening.

AUGUST 11TH 2045 @ 1400

Phoenix shoots us a message saying that she’s going to publish the story — and she thanks Emerick for the footage. The story goes out and it does pretty well — some big people get invested and within half an hour the story is on the news. She eventually messages again saying that the story’s done well and she’s gotten funding from people and she wants to pay us back: we all receive our payments. (1,500 for everyone, 2,000 for Emerick)
