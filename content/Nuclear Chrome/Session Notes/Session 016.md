Before showing up at the meeting described below, Garf got an apartment so she no longer has to live at the [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]] safehouse.

---

[[Phoenix]] calls [[Net]] and asks if we can meet up for the job. He says he will herd all the cats together, sending out details. Everyone receives the details and meet up at the appointed time and place. The meet is at a dedicated garage for 4 cars that has a ground car (likely Phoenix's, based on the paint). There is a lounge area and a makeshift office area that has a table with papers, maps, and plans. Phoenix is next to her notes, reviewing the documents.

Everyone but Net shows up around the same time, and [[Torrent]] was already there. Phoenix gets drinks for those that want them and sits around with us and we small talk. It is mentioned that Phoenix doesn't like [[Juice]].

Phoenix asks what approach we would like to go for with this mission. We all discuss the drone that Net made: it has a 6 mile radius from the controller, and a camera, but no weapons.

Phoenix mentions that that she *already has all of the forged IDs that we need*. She went ahead and did this last week while we were all dealing with our own things.

[[Omen]] asks if we can avoid contact and she doesn't think that this is possible. The group eventually agrees that we should go for the fake shipment plan. We talk back and forth a lot about what to do, and Phoenix ultimately says the fake shipment idea is very good. We talk a little more, and she admits that she isn't sure how open employees are about test subjects, so we likely shouldn't forge a shipment about bodies. Net suggests spare parts, since they are a cyberware r&d company, and Phoenix thinks this is an excellent idea.

Omen asks if there will be a way for us to directly contact the doctor, suggesting that we could always offer to be guinea pigs for this mission. As a group we think this is a very bad idea.

ID Numbers:
- Torrent: 42069
- Omen: 42070
- Net: 42071
- [[Emerick]]: 42072
- [[Garf]]: 42073
- [[Cipher]]: 42074
- Phoenix: 42075

Garf says that we will take care of getting the van for this job.
- Omen will steal it
- Net and Omen will pretty it up

For the fake shipment, we will need a fake company to sell it. This will require:
- Website
- Fake reviews
- Burner phone with a number

Emerick will handle the fake company and related items. **If the website is successful after the mission then our heat after the mission will be reduced.** He will also ask Seo for help on the forged invoice.

Net leaves.

We all need to know the area. Phoenix doesn't have shift or shipment rotations, nor does she have guard positions. What she does have is the general vicinity of everything. She hands everyone a picture of the area so that we can review it.

Phoenix finally asks who will be doing all of the talking. We say Garf did a good job previously, and Phoenix explains that we shouldn't need to do much talking and we will need to take the shipment in - only one or two crates of things, maximum. Phoenix also mentions that no matter what the shipment is, we cannot take it to [[Markov]] directly. We will need to be sneaky and overstay our welcome. The best case is that we get Garf to a secure location so she can jack in. The security office will have an AP, but is also swarming with guards. We do know that Garf does need to jack in. Garf wants to probe the NET architecture before we go.

**!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TORRENT FOX PAST LIFE ðŸ¦Š !!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Emerick sent all of the notes of information that Net had missed live, since Net had left.

Net goes to the prison that his uncle is being held at. As he waits, a cop calls out to Net and recognize him: one of the officers from around where his family operated from. This cop had watched Net grow up. They small talk and catch up a little bit, and then Net is called to talk to his uncle. [[Javier]] is wearing a four point chain when he is brought out this time.

He asks if the bail has been posted yet, and Net gives him shit for the lack of pleasantries. Net has the bail money right now. Javier says that things are fine enough, he isn't being beat every day. Net has some questions, but he allows Javier to ask any questions he may have first.

Javier asks how Cipher is doing, and Net gives Javier so much shit.

Javier explains that all he has heard is that Net asked about the bail, and that the family has been fine. He wants to go home, but he can't at this time. He again asks how everyone is doing, and Net explains that he is here because Javier is all that Net has left of his father. He doesn't like the man very much, but he does love him. Net cares for him for the sake of [[Esperanza]] and the others, and helps out of being obligated to do so rather than wanting to.

Net works himself up that he is momentarily nonverbal. He takes a moment to calm himself down, then continues. He doesn't wish Javier to die or to be in prison, and he doesn't want Esperanza to suffer for his or Javier's mistakes. Javier tells Net to have a good day, hangs up the phone, and leaves.

Net leaves and wants a cigarette.
