[[Emerick]] receives two notifications on his Agent. One is that the date of the invention fair is posted - Sept 22, 2045. Retroactively, Emerick is also aware of a police precinct address to the public on August 28, 2045 - this speech will be given by the police chief. The second notification is a text from [[Phoenix]] asking what the fuck happened.

Emerick sends a question mark because he's too high to string too many thoughts together, and she explains that she's hearing that it sounds like [[Charley]] was shot and she knows that we work for the band, is everything okay? Emerick responds at first with no, then starts to type out an explanation to the best of his ability - eventually getting there.

---

[[Saint]] struggles with words on how to talk about who he is and where he's come from. This is all very sudden and he's maybe a little overwhelmed.

[[Net]] gets an interesting message on his Agent from [[Trash Tablet]] - all that it says is that he's back and would like to talk. Net visibly tenses and Saint uses this moment to divert and asks Net what's wrong. Net stares at his phone and [[Omen]] asks if he needs a ride, and Net asks if Omen wants to meet his uncle, to which Omen says sure. Net says no, that's the wrong answer, and then messages Tab asking him to buy time. Tab says sure, Net owes him. It turns out that Saint's clinic is in the SE part of Santo Domingo near where Net's from, and Net says he doesn't need a ride.

Net stands and fixes his hair and Omen gives him a pack of cigs. Net says that offer's still open to meet his gang leader uncle. Omen says if he's in prison he's not super interested. Saint asks what organization he's part of, and Net says that makes him sound like a cop, but eventually gives him the name [[Santo Domingo Duendecitos]]. 

[[Seo]] speaks up and says we should all go home, and Omen says that he would like to speak to us about our living situation. He says that it's bad and Seo agrees, but says we can discuss this on the way back. He looks over at Saint and thanks him for patching up Charley, then heads out, with Emerick trailing after him. Everyone makes their way out of their own accord.
Garf drives.

---

Saint leaves the ripperdoc and locks the door and heads to see his family.

---

OOC:
>Saint's father - middle management - big company of Mel's choice, not particularly high. Mother used to work for people but she died (mysteriously disappeared) because they were involved with some gangs and stuff, not the Santo Domingo Duendecitos. Father is somehow involved with gangs, it's somehow dad's fault mom is died. 

---

Seo, Omen, and [[Garf]] are in the car with Garf driving. Omen says that we need to talk about the living arrangements for Seo and Emerick, and he offers perhaps Garf has space, or he can get something set up in the badlands. Omen admits he's worried about everyone's safety, and Seo replies that he genuinely appreciates Omen's concerns. He admits that the events of tonight have changed things, but he doesn't wish to make any rash decisions. He would consider a weekend or a night, but he doesn't feel that permanent or semi-permanent is feasible right now because of the same reason that would require to leave. We all saw what just happened tonight.

Seo says that the fight between the two of them purely because Charley has a drinking problem, and it's a problem with the thing that we do. [[Juice]] is an idiot, and Charley uses his drinking problem to basically throw apart whatever plan Juice has for any given situation. Seo admits he doesn't know much about Charley - he doesn't know if he has a family, but he's very paternal towards the rest of the band. So when these situations come up like Juice, there are times where Charley will throw chaos into the mix and will accept any of the consequences. Seo admits that Charley is not the typical drunk: he's chaotic, he goes crazy, he parties way too hard - this is the first time there's been a violent response from Juice. This is the first time Juice has made it known he's not above physically hurting everyone, outside of the drugs, of course. The reason to get out of it is the reason we have to stay: it's the man we work with. If Seo wants something off the grid, he's saying goodbye. That's first and foremost. He's not going to live somewhere permanently or semi-permanently, and still work with that fucker, and [[Ri]] is in way too deep right now anyhow.

Seo doesn't wish to sound like he has it worse than all of us - he acknowledges that we all have our own issues, and we were al drugged - but Ri is addicted to synthcoke, and he's so into this addiction that there is a permanent haze to everything that he does. If he is leaving, he has to take Ri with him and get him help, but he doesn't have anything else to go through. The nomads won't be too happy with an ex-corpo and a failed drug-addicted rockerboy. Sure, we can all learn, but they're dragging along dead weight hiding from a dangerous man. And what about [[Alice]], Charley, [[Crack Pipe]], and [[Powder]]? If you're going to ask Seo, you're asking everyone, and it's better to deal with the problem: Juice. The world will be a much better place without Juice. 

The way Omen sees it, the best way to deal with the problem first is to provide distance from it. Seo isn't so sure: the distance will make him more pissed off, as the grip will slip on them, and that will make him angrier. He shot Charley because he couldn't control what Charley was doing, but shooting him created control. Juice didn't want the spontaneous concert. Seo will not entertain any idea until we get a new band manager, but he doesn't wish to risk what we already have.

Emerick chimes in and says it would be suspicious if he and Seo were to both go missing together, and he doesn't wish to give Juice any ammunition to hurt anyone - himself, or Seo.

Seo looks at Emerick and says that he has contingency plans, but nothing that works for everyone, and the trick is to let Juice feel in control so that he doesn't get angry.

Garf asks if we can reign Charley in, perhaps let him have some time away. Seo says that reigning Charley in is like herding cats. Garf says that it's possible to herd cats. Seo talks goes into how Charley can't change his behavior patterns as it will possibly tip Juice off. The two of them continuously talk and negotiate, with Charley pushing for things to help the band, and Charley has a level of hardline defense where he will not budge and Juice more or less respects that at this time. If Charley were to become more subservient, there is a question as to what will happen from there.

Omen offers doping Juice up, but Seo explains he's not chromed up because he's doped all the time. Seo ultimately explains that we have to keep things as they are at the moment or else things will get worse. He is grateful of everything we do, but we cannot move as of yet. We need to find a new band manager and have them talk to Charley. Seo explains that he trusts Charley in all matters when it comes to the band.

Charley is who we need to convince to move on from Juice. We're all ready to do it, but we have nobody to run to.

Seo admits it'd be nice to have a weekend away from the safehouse, and Garf offers her place. Seo says that sounds nice.

Net walks to go meet Tab and his uncle [[Javier]]. Some people wave, others divert their gaze. Net makes it to Javier's house and Tab steps up and puts a hand on Net's shoulder. He says that Javier is *pissed* right now. Not at Net, but at everyone else. Tab admits that it does little to change things right this moment, but everyone other than Net could have done more to get him out, and Javier's making it everyone's problem. Net is the only one that Javier wishes to talk to right now that won't get absolutely torn apart in rage.

Net gives a polite knock as warning - he can overhear Javier yelling at someone already. It's clear that he's absolutely pissed - saying he wasn't gone that long, and nobody's done shit around here. Net walks in and whistles, and Javier says that he finally fucking showed up. He invites Net to sit, and Net does while Javier kicks everyone else out.

Javier basically admits that he's glad that Net got him out of prison, but refuses to say thank you to him. He tells Net to shut the fuck up when Net asks for a thank you, but instead puts a case on the desk and turns it around to show a custom heavy pistol: it is totally blinged out and has gang memorabilia on it. It's absolutely a show piece. The grip has Net's name on it as part of the design.

Net takes the pistol in his hands to feel the weight of it, and examine it. He admits he isn't sure what to say, and Javier says he doesn't need to say anything, but he hopes that this is a way to start things anew. Net says he doesn't wish to push any boundaries here, and he genuinely appreciates this beautiful piece that he will treasure (thank u tio) but he was pretty sure he was promised a favor. Javier confirms. Net slips the pistol into his jacket and Javier asks if Net wishes to cash this favor in now.

Net admits he doesn't wish to cash it in yet, but he needs to tell Javier a few things. Net admits he's been doing some work on the side and recently the gang hasn't been providing, so Net has stepped away a while ago. He says that he's working for a very bad man, and it's not the kind of bad man that will start a gang war in the middle of a street, but will wait for a man to turn his back before shooting him in the head. The man's a dealer, he's a drug addict, he's abusive, controlling, and (pauses because he's describing Javier, lmao) this guy shot one of the band members that we're working for on stage during a show, for no reason - because he got drunk. The band is great people, they're invited to Net's home if it weren't a mess, but the manager is... Net can't take him out by himself, but he also doesn't want to at this time: the manager is required right now. Net will keep Javier appraised.

Javier is happy to keep an ear open and to listen. He says that Net knows the business and work he does, the gang life isn't for everyone, but for what Net did for him, he'll listen to Net and take him at his word that this man is a bad man. if what Net says is true, then Javier will be there to help. Before Net cashes in the favor, well, let's say this: we'll cash it in now. This favor ties Javier to work for a little while: he will want to learn some things about Juice, such as to speak to Charley, or the whole band. If we're going to be doing work, and you want them to have a new manager, he can only help so much without talking to them. He has no desire to be a shadow that is far-off. He wants to sit at the table with them.

Net gets his Agent out and sets it on the table. He admits he's been running with some edgerunners: a good group, and [[Cipher]]'s running with them. He doesn't want anything to happen to them. Net explains that his group are vulnerable, and if Javier uses this as an excuse to indoctrinate more people, then, well, Javier knows how Net feels about that, about Javier. They both know that it's luck that Net is here right now. Net says do not hurt them, do not bring them in: they are their own people, and they must stay that way. Javier promises not to hurt the edgerunners or the band, and Net says he will trust him because he gave his word.

*Unbeknownst to Javier, Net recorded this promise from the previous paragraph. For future evidence.*

Net promises a meeting with at least Charley, and maybe the people he's been running with. Javier prefers that the meeting be held here in his own house: if Net would open his door to them, then Javier will do the same. Net will bring as many as he can to this.

Net retrieves his Agent and stops the recording, and they say their goodbyes, with Net hoping that Javier can be a better person this time around. Net leaves.

Tab is still outside, and is glad to see that Net is still in one piece. Net himself looks dejected, and sighs. Tab says that it must have been a real discussion in there, and Net says yes, a favor. Tab says that musta been a serious favor, and Net admits he recorded him - and Tab says they need to go elsewhere to discuss this. Net says this will be very fasts: he recorded Javier about this, with a promise, and the word is bond: Javier will not hurt anyone, or drug them, or indoctrinate them. If he breaks this promise then Tab's gonna be the first one Net tells, and then he wants Tab to fucking tell EVERYONE else. If Javier breaks this promise to Net, then Javier is a dead man.

Net lets go of Tab and reaches for a cigarette and lights up. Tab sighs and says to remind him not to get on Net's bad side, and Net says he learned from the best, Tab won't need a reminder. Net says he needs to fucking jet, and he leaves via combat cab to go to the safehouse.
