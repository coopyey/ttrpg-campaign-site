[[Garf]] asks to check against the manifest the guard has to verify the contents while [[Net]] reviews the box to see what security it has. Garf asks Net ("Tongue") for the other shard and he gives her the behavior chip.

On the shard is a lot of REDACTED
- No shipper info
- Recipient is [[Nuclear Chrome]]

Tracking information, security, contents -> they're five enemies of Nuclear Chrome.

Net feels that the box is rather specialized and something about this isn't right. The make doesn't exist on it. It has reinforced paneling, bulletproof glass, and is a 5" thick block of glass. He's unaware of any specialized features other than the keypad and biometric lock. Net tells her that this is not worth it and he admits he can't crack this. Garf asks not to worry as it will be safer once they get her out.

The guard finally starts to ask for identification, and Garf tries to call the guard's boss. He says he will take them to talk to his boss, then. The guard hits the lock button on the box so that it closes.

---

Bruce, who had crept close to monitor the situation of Net, Garf, and [[Omen]], retreats back to the stakeout area to retrieve the car from the Bozos. 

---

The guard starts ushering Garf, Omen, and Net to the big boss. Garf bitches about the way the guard is wasting her time, and he says they're wasting his time. He asks for the chip back, and Net moves to block a laser sight on Garf and removes the chip to return it to the guard. Garf begins reaching for her gun and Net explains how dire the situation is right now.

They update the group via group text, and tell Bruce to cease and desist.

[[Torrent]] is with [[Katchya]] and Katchya's phone goes off with the emergency rington. She asks what is happening and learns that there is an ongoing cyberpsycho attack that the girls need to respond to. They gather their things and head to the scene.

There is gunfire, an abandoned ambulance, and corpses all over the place. There are about ten critically wounded civilians. The [[Night City Police Department]] have a medical crate near them filled with medical supplies. The officer that greets them tells them to keep their heads down, and explains there are about six speedheals for them to use, and to get working.

Katchya takes three of the speedheals, leaving three for Torrent. About 100 feet away is NCPD shooting at the cyberpsycho. The cyberpsycho seems to have a grenade launcher as their pop up weapon, and they're decked out in everything including a sandevistan. Nobody on the ground needs surgery, but they need to be stabilized and cared for so they can be moved.

Torrent stabs the first person closest to her and is laughing while Katchya goes to help someone. Torrent advises that they leave the scene, then goes to help a second one while Katchya also moves to her second.

The police are doing their best with this attack, but the cyberpsycho is absolutely fucking them up. ☹️

In the distance, someone calls out asking for some medical assistance. Torrent ignores the injured cop to help more civilians, while Katchya is focused on the job and helping anyone. Torrent can hear a cop calling for MaxTac backup as support. The cyberpsycho isn't paying attention to Katchy and Torrent as they are healing civilian - he is more interested in killing cops.

Katchya runs out of speedheels and asks how many Torrent has (four) and Katchya asks for some. In total, eight people were saved (four each). One cop dies. The additional speedheels arrive and give one to Torrent, and the rest to Katchya.

More police and cyberpsycho struggles occur, and MaxTac finally appears and puts the cyberpsycho down. Katchya is uneasy and rather bothered by this situation, but she is doing her best to not let it get to her. She's glad that she did manage to save some people and Torrent reassures her that she will figure this whole thing out eventually. This cheers Katchya up a bit and they hug.

The medtech that was also on site - Floyd, with the nickname Jeff - offers for them to come to the hospital, but Katchya wants to go home, so the girls go home.

[[Cipher]] hung out with Net while he worked on the drone at the workshop, and then spent the night there as well. the morning was pretty normal. He eventually goes to the [[Thinker's Den]]. The vibe right now is it's more of a living space for someone instead of an actual working space for people.

Cipher shows up and [[Josh]] bear hugs him and asks how things are. Cipher explains it's about the same and he can't really talk about what's going on, then goes on to explain that [[Mamá Rosa]] was theatrical. As he talks it becomes clear that Josh is concerned as he asks if Cipher needs anything, and he says no, and that [[Juice]] and the group and band don't know the group. Josh says to keep his nose clean and advises that he not allow himself to get in too deep. He points out that edgerunning isn't the best situation and if Net would just stop and think things might be better.

There is more back and forth with Cipher asking Josh and the others to stay out of all of this business so that they can remain safe.

[[Harper]]  comes out and Cipher explains that he's here to get away from things for a little while. She says he can hang out and they have some preem new BDs to check out. They all vibe in the lounge area and chill for a while, though Cipher does have to get back to [[Mamá Rosa]] for dinner.

---

Net sends Cipher a message essentially saying "Goodbye, I love you," while being escorted to the guard boss. He tells Cipher not to come, and says it's not [[Juice]].

Bruces gets the Bozo car and returns, flooring the car and bailing out of it as it runs into the gate of the warehouse with all of the goods. It slams into the front guard (Cedric) and Bruce uses his grapple gun to begin climbing the building as Cedric calls the Militech security team over comms to raise the alarm as everything grows very tense.

Alarm lights go off and the security system starts as two sections of the roof come down with two turrets and the doors in and out of the warehouse lock so they cannot be opened from the outside.

---

[[Emerick]] and [[Seo]] see Bruce run the car and bail, then Emerick sees the alarm lights start to flash and there is a general state of alertness snap into the guards. We all hear a siren from somewhere.

---

Inside, the security guard escorting the group is pissed off, and takes Garf, Net, and [[Omen]] to be held until the situation is cleared. They are taken to an office, with a man standing in the back at a makeshift armory. The man is putting on some heavy armorjack and picks up a riot shield along with a very heavy pistol. Everything is Militech branded. The weapon specifically is a Militech Perseus. The security officer explains what is going on. 

As a note, Omen had managed to sneak away before reaching the office, but after the alarm went off.

The big guy looks at Garf and Net and asks what their deal is. The guard is surprised he lost a prisoner, but chooses to roll with it and explains the story of looking at the [[Nuclear Chrome]] shipment. The big man doesn't buy it, but for now advises the guard needs to watch them while he takes care of the mess that set off the alarms. The boss leaves, and the security guard follows and locks the door.

Garf tries to sucker punch Net, though we will find out how that ends next session.
