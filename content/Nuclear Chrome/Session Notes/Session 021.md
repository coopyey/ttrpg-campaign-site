[[Cipher]] and [[Garf]] make it to the same AP that Garf found previously. They do the stuff.

At the cryolab, we are finishing everything up. [[Phoenix]] gets everything she needs and while we are standing around, [[Emerick Kline]] and [[Omen]] hear the guards tuning into their ear pieces. We hear that there’s a suspicious pair of individuals that just came from the labs and went on to the elevators and are on the first floor of the bedrooms and are currently on that floor. All the guards are to be aware and they are sending guards to sweep that floor. Nobody is leaving the room we are in. One guard does tap [[Markov]] on the shoulder and relays this information to him. Markov looks at us and says that a few of our comrades are upstairs and are getting into trouble. He is specifically addressing Net, then looks at the rest of us.

[[Net]] explains that they’re adventurous when they shouldn’t be and Markov clearly is concerned about some information getting out. Markov will let us go if we can prove they haven’t gotten into anything. We’re on thin fucking ice but he seems to accept this. Net asks what Markov would like to get out and Markov says that Net owes him a favor, to be collected later. The favor would require Net to make something, perhaps. Net agrees and Markov says that we are being watched very carefully and he will be in contact very shortly. Net takes the business card being offered.

We head out and on the way out we see a woman walking past with a small spider drone - it was [[Ida Mueller]] herself, walking past with the prototype spiderbot. We get into the elevator to retrieve our strays.

Cipher and Garf are still net running when we get there. Net goes up and puts Cipher’s fire out. We’re waffling about what to do and Emerick hears a guard walking down the hall. Net tells them to try to jack out and Cipher and Garf start to argue about who’s closer to the files. Emerick hisses to Net and Cipher that there is a guard walking down the hallway and we need to fucking leave. They stay in.

Something jacks into the network: Ida’s spiderbot. It folds open and goes down to where Garf is. It has a row of programs open up and has a cyberdeck built in to itself.

Emerick hears a silent alarm going off in the facility. His eyes go wide and he grabs Phoenix’s arm and firmly tells her that they have sounded an alarm and we need to leave. Emerick (me, Coop) remembers what the bot actually is and what it’s for — and he clearly starts to grow panicked.

Cipher begs to finish this and get the file and Garf is doing okay and they and Emerick bicker until Phoenix tells them to shut the fuck up. Cipher ultimately decides to unsafely jack out in order to get a move on.
