Things to do:

News:
>A series of bombs go off in The Glenn after Nuclear Chrome is invested in by Merill, Asukaga, & Finch, with 3 other groups left dead.

In the main area of the safehouse are Powder, and Ri. Powder heads to the kitchen and expresses her concern for us and asks if we take Ogre with us for anything. After the latest from Nuclear Chrome she is just worried. Ri, on the other hand, is a hot mess who just woke up. Another band member, Seo, walks in. Unlike Ri, he is clean and well-dressed, very well presenting. Ri begins to get worked up because there is no more smash in the fridge, so he decides to send Garf out to get more, and tells her to take the rest of us with her so she doesn't get killed.

Omen takes us to Old Japantown to get the smash. There is the sound of far-off combat in this portion of the combat zone. Emerick gives Torrent a piggy-back ride as she refuses to walk here, so he carries her into the store with everyone. Net does most of the talking and the guy running the store goes into the back to get us a few cases of the beer.

While we wait, a few bikers show up in the alley across the way. Omen notices and mentions it to us. Garf was going to go deal with it (with her fucking bastard sword? hello?) but then got distracted with another conversation going on. After some arguments and 120 eddies, we get 3 cases of smash and head back to the car. We pile into the van and the gangsters that Omen pointed out - the same guys we scared off at the scav hideout we realize - recognize us and begin to pursue us.

We end in combat. It will be Omen's turn. Emerick killed one goon - all goons are dismounted and currently attacking Garf, who jumped out of the fucking van to try to steal a bike from one of the gangers.
