We continue combat, opening with [[Garf]] taking a shotgun blast to the face.

We finally end combat and Garf starts mutilating the corpse of the Bozo that had the shotgun and shot her. She eventually collapses as she's bleeding. We all start to come to terms with the state of everything, and [[Emerick]] calls [[Torrent]] for help.

Torrent, after therapying Louie, goes home to [[Katchya]] and explains what is going on. She goes and relaxes on the couch as Katchya turns on some music to help her chill. Torrent convinces Katchya to sleep on the couch and it is around midnight when Emerick starts calling her incessantly. She isn't pleased, but Emerick explains that Garf is almost dead and they need her help. She groans and wakes Katchya up and they head to the stakeout location.

Bruce is rocking back and forth, apologizing to his father because they're all dead - constantly apologizing.

Torrent and Katchya arrive. Katchya helps Bruce and helps talk him down from his dissociative state. She prepares him for surgery to fix his broken limb. Torrent, meanwhile, stabilizes Garf and gives her a speedheal while Emerick apologizes for disturbing her. Katchya and Torrent then do the surgery to fix Bruce's arm and that goes fine, with Torrent giving him a speedheal. The girls go back home while Bruce goes back to the stakeout.

[[Net]] meets up with [[Cipher]] and they aren't sure if they are in the right business. Net did talk to his uncle and he thinks [[Javier]] might actually help with this, if he pays the bail out.

Cipher feels that he won't be paid for the job and Net reassures him that there are people who will help, though Cipher isn't very convinced. Net goes to work on a drone, then falls asleep at his desk.

[[Seo]] and Emerick take a moment to talk. Seo asks if he is okay, and Emerick reassures him that he's fine, and that he's been through worse. Seo says that it's still a lot, and Emerick just continues to reassure him that everything is fine. He also reinforces the idea that they are there to protect Seo, even if Seo is helping them with this gig.

We all settle down and when Bruce arrives back from the hospital he gets out of the car and the driver is shot by a sniper. We all hide and wait for things to calm down, and eventually Garf is ready for the job to steal the surprise box. Emerick expresses hesitation, but he shuts up when Garf says that she wants to do it.

Seo calls Net and says they're ready. Net takes some time to preen, then goes to the stakeout location to meet up with the rest of us. Garf also does her own preening while waiting. She does an okay job, but she needs Net's magic touch to fix up the rest of her fit.

[[Garf]] changes her fur to a royal blue color. Net and Seo work together to make Garf completely look the part, then they work together to make Net look more like a corpo bodyguard, and they pull it off. They remove Garf's behavior chip at her request, with Net holding onto it for later.

Garf explains the plan:
>*Net is a security expert, and they are representatives for [[Nuclear Chrome]]. They heard of the difficulties in this area so they are going to check the security of the place and pick up this high value package early so that it is not raided.*

Omen will be the driver, of course.

All of the appropriate people pile into the van and pulls up to the warehouse with the goods. A Militech guard taps the driver window, but Garf rolls her window down and speaks instead. She explains that Omen is mute and she puts on very fed-up airs as she speaks. She explains she's here to pick up the package because of how tense things are, and the guard explains that things have been pretty quiet, actually.

Garf introduces herself as Panther and gives this poor guy a real hard time. She chews him up one side and down the other, explaining that she is part of [[Merril, Asukaga, & Finch]], and she's there for a security detail, and there's three of them. The guard finally lets them in. Omen drives them to the main storage area as directed by the Militech personnel. They stop next to the shipment and Garf tells Net to review the security. He sees three average guys and two that seem that they are actually competent. He reviews everyone, and then lets Garf know what all he sees.

They shut off the car and park and another guard comes up to Garf and explains what all is being held here. He requests they not touch the other clients' things, and Garf gives him some lip, but everyone moves on. Garf offers to help their security with Net, and they give these guys shit about it.

Garf does ask the guard to open the box to check the key code, but nobody sees it as he enters it. Up next is a biometric scan, then the door opens. Inside are five people that are bound and gagged. Four are wearing rocker streetrat clothes, and the last is clearly some sort of exec. All of them are beat to shit. Really leaning into the role, Garf drags a scratcher along the exec's face to highlight her sadism.

Net texts the group to tell everyone that the hsipment is people.
