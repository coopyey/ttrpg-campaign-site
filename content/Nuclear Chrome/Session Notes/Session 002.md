Combat start.

There is a sharp whirring metallic sound that [[Garf]] notices, and a spray of bullets launches at [[Omen]] that he manages to dodge.

We dispatch of the scavs that were hiding out and Emerick approaches the final door and hears that there is someone inside. Emerick says that he knows they are there and is joined by [[Net]] and Omen while Garf looks around the apartment. Emerick tells them to keep their hands up and the team enters slowly.

*We find the client and can immediately tell that they are alive.* We begin looking them over to see if they are stable and we notice someone coming up to the room on the nearby security feed. They are rockerboys and they have:
- A pistol
- Welded metal nail bat
- No visible weapon

We notice that there is a motif of a chromed cyberarm doing the rock on hand sign with a mushroom cloud behind it - these guys must be associated with Nuclear Chrome.

We begin to panic as [[Nuclear Chrome]] grows impatient at the door. Emerick points out that he can use the grapple gun to get the client to safety while the others deal with the situation at hand.

Net and Garf scare the shit out of Nuclear Chrome and manages to scare them off, and so we find ourselves safe as we all begin to calm down. We check the other unconscious people for signs of life.

Loot:
- all weapons poor
- 10 shotgun slugs
- 2 clips of smg (total)
- 2 clips of heavy pistol ammo (per person)

Garf finds 120 eddies, takes 110, and gives 10 eddies to Emerick.

We make it to the rendezvous point and it is not a long wait before a car pulls up with [[Serpent]] and another fixer, [[Juice]]. While we were waiting, Net made an extended mag for his pistol.

The older gentleman is not happy with how things transpired, but is happy enough that this is over. He's an absolute unit of a man. The older man *is* impressed with our work, and pays us 1,000 eddies. We follow the fixer to get more details about the next gig, since he has one lined up. He meets us at an abandoned warehouse in the western part of the combat zone where it is relatively isolated.

We meet [[Torrent]]: a 4'4" tall young lady with pink and white hearts on her cheeks. She is introduced as the medtech that will join our merry band.

As we chat, a younger woman walks out and she introduces herself as [[Powder]]. She explains that she is the driver for the band - [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]] - and she offers to drive us if necessary for jobs. 

Juice explains to us that as long as we are employed by him we may live here if we wish, free of charge. The next mission is what he wishes to really discuss, though, but he explains that Charles is no longer associated with the band anymore.

We learn that Juice is the band manager, and [[Ogre]] is the MEAT (security). The client for the previous mission was a friend of Juice's and they had dirt about Nuclear Chrome that is rather important. He explains that he wants to hire us to help work towards taking care of and disposing of Nuclear Chrome so that he can put CSWV back on top of the charts.
