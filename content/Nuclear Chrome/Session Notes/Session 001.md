Thursday, the day for mission details. Meet @ [[The Afterlife]], ask for [[Serpent]] or Charles.

[[Omen]]:
- Mute by choice
- A glass mask with digital lights in place of eyes that emote like expressions (Daft Punk)

Serpent:
- Pacifica
- Tribal tattoos with a serpent tattoo going down his arm. Vibrant neon green ink.

Charles:
- Rockerboy
- 5'10" with lots of fashionware. Right arm has speakers on it.

Everyone else arrives after a few minutes. Serpent describes the mission to us:
> *Rescue a corpo agent from the scavs down the road. They are holed up in a studio apartment. Expect 6-8 of them, but keep an eye open because a new group is out for blood as well. Rumor has it that this client is related to the band Nuclear Chrome. They will likely try to recover the client we are attempting to recover. We need to verify the condition of the client, then report to Trauma Team of bring them back. We will receive 1,000 eddies for bringing them back alive.*

Serpent notes that the scavs are cowardly but Nuclear Chrome could be a real problem if they do show up. We can keep any loot or information that we find at the site, this job only cares that the client is recovered. If we find anyone else there at the site then we will get a bonus for recovering them as well, capping out at up to five bodies at the scav hangout. We will also receive a bonus if we can send Nuclear Chrome packing if they do show their faces.

Omen drives us over and we discuss how to reach floor 15, room 10.

[[Net]] comes up with the following plan:
- [[Net]] and Charles sneak into the room.
- [[Garf]] will go into the vents and scout things out.
- [[Omen]] and [[Emerick]] will grapple onto the outer balcony and wait for commotion.

*We learn that there is a fixer in the Glen that we are aware of named [[Mr. Steele]]. We realize that he set up a hit on this client that we are rescuing. Mr. Steel is rumored to be nearing cyberpsychosis.*

We start sneaking in and it is not long until combat starts.
