We all turn to see [[Juice]] holding a gun after having shot [[Charley]], with [[Ogre]] behind him. [[Net]] immediately rushes up and applies pressure to the wound, with Emerick joining him moments after and starting to fumble for his phone to call emergency services.

Juice calls [[Emerick]] over to help him, saying he needs assistance, and he announces that [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]] won't be performing in these conditions. He says if they want to help then he will drop a piece of paper on the floor, then starts to walk away. [[Omen]] picks up the paper and sees that there's someone named [[Saint]] on it, with a number, and that they're a medtech.

Everyone immediately starts arguing about what to do with [[Garf]] yelling to get him ready and she'll get him on the bike and take him to the hospital, and then Net freaking out about him being on the bike. Garf asks if we're going to wait for a fucking car, and they fight until Emerick speaks up.

Emerick grabs Net's arm and asks him to make sure that [[Charley]] is okay and makes it through this, and net agrees, and then Emerick glances at [[Seo]] and then gets up and follows after Juice. Once Emerick makes it to Ogre, Ogre finally stands down and starts to walk out. Charley starts to come to and asks what to do about this, and Net instructs him to keep pressure on the dressing he put together for Charley and asks Seo for help carrying him to the car. [[Alice]] and [[Ri]] call out that they'll meet the group for Charley at the hospital, asking for the info to be texted to them.

Omen calls out to Emerick asking if he really wants to follow Juice, and Emerick simply slumps and shrinks as he follows after Juice.

- Omen, Net, Charley, and Seo in the groundcar
- Garf and Cipher on the bike
- Alice and Ri in their own car

They are headed to the medtech that Juice had the paper for.

Y'all thought I'd leave this conversation in huh :p

As the rest of the group is driving through the city and making their way through the streets, they make it to the address they have on paper. Emerick is already there, taking a hit of his weed. Net is already telling Seo to help him bring Charley in.

The clinic itself is a ghost town tonight. It's urban derelict chic, basically. Many people walk into the establishment and someone's clearly shot. Saint encourages everyone inside and gets Charley to a place he can be worked on. Net commands that Saint fix him, and pulls out 500 eddies and shoves it right into Saint's chest, then starts walking out of the room.

Saint patches Charley up without much difficulty. He gets patched up and is resting after Saint is back. Saint asks what the fuck happened to everyone still inside, and Seo looks at him and explains that the band manager is who shot him. Saint is confused as to why a band manager would do that, then pulls out a notebook from a drawer what's going on, and mentioning that this is the fifth time this week.

Charley asks for confirmation, and Net confirms, then storms out to go outside. Charley stands up to leave, and finds Cipher not far, Seo in the room, Saint here, and then Garf sitting in the waiting room. Saint helps Charley up to help him walk to the car, and Net takes his jacket back from Cipher, with Net actually zipping the jacket up all the way. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cigarette pack and starts to smoke.

Emerick and Net smoke together outside, with Charley stepping outside and pulling out a cigarette to smoke. Garf manages to steal Charley's cigarette pack and Charley says he's the one that got fucking shot. Garf and Net say it's not good for him and he needs to recover. Emerick gravitates towards Seo just naturally.

Saint comes out and invites us all inside to smoke inside of his clinic, and Net explains he is being courteous and Garf and Omen both immediately explain that Net is too hard-headed to agree. Cipher is thousand yard staring at Saint, and Saint also blank stares back. Net pulls out his own kitsune mask and stares at Saint, then eventually takes the mask off and puts it away. Omen asks how Juice knows him, and Saint just had Juice come to him needing help. The good fixers don't come to him because he can't work miracles, and Net explains he should market himself as a supplement thing.

Charley heads out and Omen says they can't just let this go, and Charley explains that he knows, and he knows that things are bad. He knows that this is not a good situation and this will not be the last time it's bad. He explains that we are the first edgerunners that have lasted long enough that he can actually give a shit about us.

Saint has an expression of "oh shit, oh fuck," and then he starts to smile in his anxiety response. He heads inside waiting for everyone else to join him.

Alice and Ri takes Charley back to the safehouse, with Seo staying behind for Emerick.

A text message comes through to Emerick from Juice that he's glad to hear everything's okay, and he expects us all back as soon as possible. Emerick asks if Saint is also included in that, and Juice responds with "if he's an asset to us all".
