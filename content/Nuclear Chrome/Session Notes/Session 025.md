Torrent's player is having to drop the campaign due to some real life issues.

---

We all arrive at the bar where [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]]'s show is going to be. We get our drinks and feel the vibe of the place. We decide we do want to help out with the show and help set things up. We make our way over to [[Charley Cook]] and he has us help get things set up with the show, and he admits he has a small little treat planned for networking in the evening. As we are mingling, [[Garf]] tried to get [[Torrent]] to understand what a mac n cheese bite is like and she adamantly said mac n cheese is gross, and demanding boxed apple juice be put into a glass. Other than that, [[Omen]] is blind and missed the fact that the TMNT showed up and walked into the place. He then stared in disbelief that they were there, and was amazed that they were a poser gang of all things. Garf was also stumped by this turn of events. [[Emerick Kline]] was off hanging out with [[Ri Tae-Woo]] and [[Alice]], catching up with them and talking about the articles he's currently working on and the leads he has right now.

---

As we are all working on everything, [[Torrent]] receives a phone call from [[Katchya]]. It is important that she leaves and goes to home and she is VERY excited about this. She has to say goodbye to all of us and then leaves to go back to Katchya's. (Katchya is leaving this campaign.)

Everyone settles into the club and hangs out, settling in for the evening. Alice and Ri eventually get up and head back stage to Charley, with [[Seo Tae-Woo]] swinging by to say hi to Emerick and explain he's headed back to work with the band on the surprise. Emerick wishes him luck and they separate.

[[Crack Pipe]] also shows up to actually show support for CSWV. Crack Pipe does the rounds and says hi to everyone, making it to [[Net]] and asking if he's hanging in there. Net's sunken into the very uncomfortable bar booth with [[Cipher]]. Net says he's okay and Crack Pipe is glad to hear that. Net admits he hasn't had a cigarette today - which makes Crack Pipe proud. Crack Pipe offers to buy Net a drink and he accepts, asking for something custom. They talk a little more and Crack Pipe eventually breaks away to say hi to everyone else and see what the band is going to be getting themselves into.

Eventually enough people get into the group and they open up the dance floor for everyone and a karaoke stand has opened up in a smaller part of the bar for those who are interest. A few perform and dance, and sing, and then we mingle with the crowd.

Some commotion cuts through the good times and the music and joy. It initially sounds like rowdy people, but it gets louder and tables start to shuffle and glasses break. It doesn't sound like a fight but it's not okay. We move our way to the noise to see what's going on and we see not much. Emerick, because of his heightened hearing, can tell someone is a little too drunk - and he pinpoints that it's Charley. He can tell that Charley is not having a good time, stumbling around and being a complete asshole. He's speaking in cursive. He is the show right now and is stumbling his way through everything.

Emerick (with Garf as backup), Omen, and the rest of the band moves to Charlie. Behind the band is [[Juice]], taking notice of Charley, and he's PISSED. Juice is not at all happy about this. Juice has only approached Emerick at the very beginning of the day before all of this. [[Ogre]] is there as well. This is clearly the most pissed we've seen Juice.

Omen attempts to talk to Charley and he puts his arms out and is absolutely done. Emerick tries to talk to Charley and he speaks, the words are worthless but Emerick can tell by his lips (via inferring) and Charley asked "hey what's up". Charley quickly then gets sidetracked by Net. Net is coming in thinking this is the pit opening, but he mouths at Emerick to get this man a mic and get him on stage to start the show. The group works together to get the alcohol away from Charley and get him a mic and get him toward the stage.

We manage to get him a guitar and mic and Charley is absolutely so sloshed he is totally open to the idea of having the mic, guitar, and a path to the stage to perform. Charley gets up there perform and we hear a gunshot, and we see blood bloom at Charley's stomach. We see Juice with his arm extended before him, clearly pissed. He's the one that shot Charley, clearly.
