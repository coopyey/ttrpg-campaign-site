**Class:** Nomad, Tech

Nomad and techie for [[Curb Stomping Word Vomit]]. He is the former driver for the band and has been working with [[Powder]] to ensure that she can drive with enough care to transport all of the equipment necessary for the band.

He is now the demolitions "expert" and seems to be assuming a role of protector in the band, not willing to put up with anyone's ([[Net]]'s) shitty behavior.
