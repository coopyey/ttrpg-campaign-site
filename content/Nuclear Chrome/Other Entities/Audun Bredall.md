 Audun operates with a real iron fist and is a hard-ass. He's on trial for faked cyberpsycho attacks in the last two years, but the government is really dragging their feet on the trial. Leaving him as chief is in their best interest, but people (the public) are overall getting upset about this, especially over the false imprisonments and deaths of family members.
