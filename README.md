# Coop's TTRPG Archive Site

The purpose of this repo is to provide an easy place for me to take notes for all of the TTRPGs that I am in and provide hosting through Github Pages so that all of the party members in each campaign can review previous sessions, NPCs, etc. It also allows anyone that isn't in each campaign follow along as well. 😊

The website is using Quartz v4 to publish my Obsidian vault as a website.

The published site is [here](https://ttrpg.coopyey.gay).

# Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
